If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.  == devonfw setup    If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.  ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn node ng npm)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.   The installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.      == Clone Repository First, clone the Jump-The-Queue Repository.    ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. In this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.  After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue.git` in the terminal.    == Build and Run Java Server  === Build the Java project with Maven     ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].  ==== Execution  Now move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/java/jtqj` in the terminal. Next, use the following command to build the java project.  `mvn clean install`  The maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state. Install will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.     === Run Java Server     === Prerequisites * Maven (can be included in your devonfw environment)  === Starting the server  First, change the current working directory to where your server is located, i.e. `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/java/jtqj/server`.  Afterwards, use maven to start the server: `mvn spring-boot:run`. This command will start the Java server.    === Startup Assertion  You can check if the server is running correctly by checking if `localhost:8081/jumpthequeue` is accessible by either using a tool like `curl`, `Postman` or simply accessing the service via your webbrowser.  Example: `curl -Is localhost:8081/ | head -n 1`  This command should return an `200 OK` header if the service is available.    Now the Java Server should be running.   === Install dependencies In the next steps we want build and run the Angular Frontend Server. For that you need to install the dependencies first.    ==== Prerequisites  * Install Node.js. You can download Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/[here]. * Installed npm. You can download npm https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm[here] and follow the installation instructions.  ==== Execution  You need to be located in the project directory where the package.json file lies. For this tutorial it is `/home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/angular`. You can either move there manually and open the terminal there or open the terminal and move there by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/angular`.  Now execute `npm install` in the terminal.   This may take some time.    == Serve the Frontend Server  === Changing of the environment.ts file Now build and run the Angular Server. The following two steps are only needed in this tutorial. Normally you can simply execute \"ng serve\", open the https://localhost:4200/ and start using the app. In the next step you need to change the Base URL for the REST Services.       ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of environment.ts in any Editor   To change the file environment.ts, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to environment.ts and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/angular/src/environments` and select the file `environment.ts`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner environment.ts will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, typescript] ---- https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8081-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/jumpthequeue/services/rest ----   To replace the content with a specific placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file. The fastest way is to search through the opened file and replace *http://localhost:8081/jumpthequeue/services/rest* with the new content.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and environment.ts has been changed.    "

Mocking is essentially simulating the behaviour of real data in controlled ways. So in order to use mock data effectively, it is essential to have a good understanding of the software under test and more importantly how it uses its data. As with most things, there are both advantages and disadvantages to doing this.  One of the big advantages with mock data is that it makes it possible to simulate errors and circumstances that would otherwise be very difficult to create in a real world environment. A disadvantage however is that without good understanding of the software, it will be possible to manipulate data in ways which would never actually happen in the real world.  ## Mock Service  Services are often the smoothest files to unit test. A mock service imitates a real REST or SOAP API – it contains definitions for operations that clients call, receives requests, and returns simulated responses.  When testing a component with service dependencies, the best practice is mocking them, in order to test the component in an isolated environment. In fact, our purpose is testing the component, not the services, that can be trouble, especially if they try to interact with a server.  Here, we will go through a angular-mock-service sample app.      image::images/leaderboard.png[]  The app presents 3 pages as follows:  * A leader board with the top 3 elements A leader board can be understood as &#34;the most popular items in a set&#34;, &#34;the latest updated items&#34;, &#34;you favorite items&#34; etc.  image::images/data-table.png[]  * A data table with all the elements A data table with CRUD operations is very useful (in our case we only view details or delete an item, but they illustrate two important things: the details view shows how to navigate and consume a parametric route, the delete action shows how to invoke service operations over the loaded data - this means that the component is reusable and when the data comes with an API, only the service will need it’s implementation changed)  image::images/detail.png[]  * A details page that reads a route parameter and displays the details of the element.        == Clone Repository First, we have to clone the Devon4ng repository to access Angular Mock Service Sample.    ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. In this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.  After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng.git` in the terminal.    === Implementing Mock Data    Let’s consider a &#39;box of data&#39; represented in JSON. Physically this means a folder with some JSON/TS files in it. They are located in the app/mock folder. The example uses only one mock data file. The file is typed according to our data model.  The model is represented by the interfaces we make. These interfaces describe the data structures we will use in our application. In this example, there is one data model, corresponding with the &#39;type&#39; of data that was mocked. In the models folder you will find the .ts script file that describes chemical elements. The corresponding mock file defines a set is chemical element objects, in accordance to our interface definition.  image::images/data-box.jpg[]        === Implementing Mock Service    A service is an injectable logic that can be consumed by all the components that need it. It can carry manipulation functions and ,in our case, fetch data from a provider. Inside the Angular App, an Injector gives access to each component to their required services. It’s good coding practice to use a distinct service to each data type you want to manipulate. The type is described in a interface.  Here we simply fetch and display the data of elements and their details.  image::images/architecture.png[]         ## Conclusion To conclude, in this tutorial you learned   * the concepts of mock data and services  * the mock architecture with the help of sample app   "

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(ng npm vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.       == What is mock data and service? ## Mock Data Mock data is fake data which is artificially inserted into a piece of software. Mocking is essentially simulating the behaviour of real data in controlled ways. So in order to use mock data effectively, it is essential to have a good understanding of the software under test and more importantly how it uses its data. As with most things, there are both advantages and disadvantages to doing this.  One of the big advantages with mock data is that it makes it possible to simulate errors and circumstances that would otherwise be very difficult to create in a real world environment. A disadvantage however is that without good understanding of the software, it will be possible to manipulate data in ways which would never actually happen in the real world.  ## Mock Service  Services are often the smoothest files to unit test. A mock service imitates a real REST or SOAP API – it contains definitions for operations that clients call, receives requests, and returns simulated responses.  When testing a component with service dependencies, the best practice is mocking them, in order to test the component in an isolated environment. In fact, our purpose is testing the component, not the services, that can be trouble, especially if they try to interact with a server.  Here, we will go through a angular-mock-service sample app.      image::images/leaderboard.png[]  The app presents 3 pages as follows:  * A leader board with the top 3 elements A leader board can be understood as &#34;the most popular items in a set&#34;, &#34;the latest updated items&#34;, &#34;you favorite items&#34; etc.  image::images/data-table.png[]  * A data table with all the elements A data table with CRUD operations is very useful (in our case we only view details or delete an item, but they illustrate two important things: the details view shows how to navigate and consume a parametric route, the delete action shows how to invoke service operations over the loaded data - this means that the component is reusable and when the data comes with an API, only the service will need it’s implementation changed)  image::images/detail.png[]  * A details page that reads a route parameter and displays the details of the element.        == Clone Repository First, we have to clone the Devon4ng repository to access Angular Mock Service Sample.    ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. In this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.  After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng.git` in the terminal.    === Implementing Mock Data    Let’s consider a &#39;box of data&#39; represented in JSON. Physically this means a folder with some JSON/TS files in it. They are located in the app/mock folder. The example uses only one mock data file. The file is typed according to our data model.  The model is represented by the interfaces we make. These interfaces describe the data structures we will use in our application. In this example, there is one data model, corresponding with the &#39;type&#39; of data that was mocked. In the models folder you will find the .ts script file that describes chemical elements. The corresponding mock file defines a set is chemical element objects, in accordance to our interface definition.  image::images/data-box.jpg[]        === Implementing Mock Service    A service is an injectable logic that can be consumed by all the components that need it.

This is independent from the target version of your developed code  1.2. Installation steps     * Open the eclipse installation dialog     menu bar → Help → Install new Software    image::images/01-install-new-software.png[]        == Select Update Site Here you can select the updates.     2. Open CobiGen’s update site     image::images/02-select-update-site.png[]      Insert the update site of your interest into the filed Work with and press Add     Stable releases: https://dl.bintray.com/devonfw/cobigen.p2/      * Follow the installation wizard     Select CobiGen Eclipse Plug-in → Next → Next → accept the license → Finish → OK → Yes      * Once installed, a new menu entry named &#34;CobiGen&#34; will show up in the Package Explorer’s context menu. In the sub menu there will the Generate​ command, which may ask you to update the templates, and then you can start the generation wizard of CobiGen.           * You can adapt the templates by clicking on Adapt Templates which will give you the possibility to import the CobiGen_Templates automatically so that you can modified them.      * Checkout (clone) your project’s templates folder or use the current templates released with CobiGen (https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/tree/master/cobigen-templates) and then choose  Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace to import the templates into your workspace.   == CobiGen Usage - Simple Mode        Selecting the menu entry Generate​ the generation wizard will be opened.          The left side of the wizard shows all available increments, which can be selected to be generated. Increments are a container like concept encompassing multiple files to be generated, which should result in a semantically closed generation output. The type of modification of each file will be encoded into following color scheme if the files are selected for generation:      - green: files, which are currently non-existent in the file system. These files will be created during generation      - yellow: files, which are currently existent in the file system and which are configured to be merged with generated contents.      - red: files, which are currently existent in the file system. These files will be overwritten if manually selected.      - no color: files, which are currently existent in the file system. Additionally files, which were unselected and thus will be ignored during generation.  image::images/03-simple-mode-usage.png[]        == CobiGen Usage - Batch Mode    If there are multiple input elements selected, e.g., Java files, CobiGen will be started in batch mode. The generation preview will be constrained to the first selected input element. It does not preview the generation for each element of the selection or of a complex input. The selection of the files to be generated will be generated for each input element analogously afterwards.  Thus the color encoding differs also a little bit:      - yellow: files, which are configured to be merged.      - red: files, which are not configured with any merge strategy and thus will be created if the file does not exist or overwritten if the file already exists      - no color: files, which will be ignored during generation  image::images/04-batch-mode-usage.png[]        ==      ## Health Check However, you might face some errors while using CobiGen. So, we recommend to perform a Health Check for CobiGen Templates for better experience.  To get more information on Health Check for CobiGen Templates visit on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_eclipse-integration.html#cobigen-eclipse_usage.asciidoc_health-check  ## Troubleshooting CLI When generating code from a Java file, CobiGen makes use of Java reflection for generating templates. In order to do that, the CLI needs to find the compiled source code of your project.  If you find an error like Compiled class foo\\bar\\EmployeeEntity.java has not been found, it means you need to run &#34;mvn clean install&#34; on the input project so that a new target folder gets created with the needed compiled sources.  ## Conclusion From this tutorial you have learned the following: * You can do CobiGen set up in your system. * You can use the CobiGen CLI commands to generate the code. * You can now integrate CobiGen with Eclipse and generate your crud services. * Now you know how to use CobiGen in a particular project with Eclipse as well as CLI.

In the sub menu there will the Generate​ command, which may ask you to update the templates, and then you can start the generation wizard of CobiGen.           * You can adapt the templates by clicking on Adapt Templates which will give you the possibility to import the CobiGen_Templates automatically so that you can modified them.      * Checkout (clone) your project’s templates folder or use the current templates released with CobiGen (https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/tree/master/cobigen-templates) and then choose  Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace to import the templates into your workspace.   == CobiGen Usage - Simple Mode        Selecting the menu entry Generate​ the generation wizard will be opened.          The left side of the wizard shows all available increments, which can be selected to be generated. Increments are a container like concept encompassing multiple files to be generated, which should result in a semantically closed generation output. The type of modification of each file will be encoded into following color scheme if the files are selected for generation:      - green: files, which are currently non-existent in the file system. These files will be created during generation      - yellow: files, which are currently existent in the file system and which are configured to be merged with generated contents.      - red: files, which are currently existent in the file system. These files will be overwritten if manually selected.      - no color: files, which are currently existent in the file system. Additionally files, which were unselected and thus will be ignored during generation.  image::images/03-simple-mode-usage.png[]        == CobiGen Usage - Batch Mode    If there are multiple input elements selected, e.g., Java files, CobiGen will be started in batch mode. The generation preview will be constrained to the first selected input element. It does not preview the generation for each element of the selection or of a complex input. The selection of the files to be generated will be generated for each input element analogously afterwards.  Thus the color encoding differs also a little bit:      - yellow: files, which are configured to be merged.      - red: files, which are not configured with any merge strategy and thus will be created if the file does not exist or overwritten if the file already exists      - no color: files, which will be ignored during generation  image::images/04-batch-mode-usage.png[]        ==      ## Health Check However, you might face some errors while using CobiGen. So, we recommend to perform a Health Check for CobiGen Templates for better experience.  To get more information on Health Check for CobiGen Templates visit on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_eclipse-integration.html#cobigen-eclipse_usage.asciidoc_health-check  ## Troubleshooting CLI When generating code from a Java file, CobiGen makes use of Java reflection for generating templates. In order to do that, the CLI needs to find the compiled source code of your project.  If you find an error like Compiled class foo\\bar\\EmployeeEntity.java has not been found, it means you need to run &#34;mvn clean install&#34; on the input project so that a new target folder gets created with the needed compiled sources.  ## Conclusion From this tutorial you have learned the following: * You can do CobiGen set up in your system. * You can use the CobiGen CLI commands to generate the code. * You can now integrate CobiGen with Eclipse and generate your crud services. * Now you know how to use CobiGen in a particular project with Eclipse as well as CLI.

You can find the documentation of the tutorial compiler here:  https://github.com/devonfw-forge/tutorial-compiler/wiki    The definition of each step of this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/tree/main/create-your-own-tutorial/.   Feel free to report any errors to us or fix them yourself. Errors can be reported by creating an issue in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/issues[tutorials repository]. To fix the error fork the repository and create a pull request. Errors in the wiki can be reported and fixed in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler[Tutorial-compiler repository]. You can find a description of what to look for when creating a pull request at the devonfw contribution guide: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/community/community.html#community.asciidoc_contributing-to-devonfw. If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.  == Fork the tutorials repository # Setup your workspace Let's start!  First of all, go to the tutorials repository on GitHub:  https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials  Fork the repository by clicking on the 'Fork' button. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. You will find it in 'Your repositories'.     image::images/fork.jpg[]   Open the forked repository in your GitHub account and copy the repository URL as shown in image below.   image::images/clone_code.jpg[]        == Clone the repository  === Clone Repository Paste the URL to the 'git clone' command to clone the repostitory. For this tutorial we will use the original tutorials repository of the 'devonfw-tutorials' GitHub account to show the workflow of creating the tutorial.  When you run the command on your machine, you will of course need to customize the URL and add your personal GitHub name. So the command will be `git clone https://github.com/YourName/tutorials.git`.      ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. In this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/`.  After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials.git` in the terminal.    == Create a new branch    Create a new branch inside the cloned repository.  Navigate into the tutorials directory.  `cd tutorials`{{execute T1}}  Create a new branch for your tutorial and switch into this branch.  `git branch tutorial/myOwnTutorial`{{execute T1}}  `git checkout tutorial/myOwnTutorial`{{execute T1}}       Now you can start to create the tutorial. This will be shown in the next steps.   == Create the index.asciidoc file # Create the tutorial  Each tutorial is located in its own directory and consists of an asciidoc file, in which the tutorial is specified. The file is always named 'index.asciidoc'.  So create a new folder in inside the tutorials directory and the file for the tutorial.     ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * Any Editor that can edit files  ==== Creating index.asciidoc in any Editor  Create index.asciidoc in any Editor.  Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work. The editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.  The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *tutorials/myTutorial/index.asciidoc*.  Select the directory `tutorials/myTutorial`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `index.asciidoc` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and index.asciidoc has been created.   == Create a pull request    Before starting write content into the tutorial, you have to create a pull request from your newly created branch into the main repository. This has the advantage that your tutorial will automatically be build and pushed to https://katacoda.com/devonfw-dev. So you can directly test it.  For this step you need to open you local terminal at your forked and cloned &#39;tutorials&#39; folder and run the following commands: 1. &#39;git add .&#39;  2. &#39;git commit -m &#34;initial commit for tutorial myTutorial&#34;&#39; 3. &#39;git push&#39;  This will save all the changes and push them into your tutorials GitHub repository.   Switch to your browser and open: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials  Click on &#39;Pull requests&#39; &gt; &#39;New pull request&#39;.   image::images/pull_request.jpg[]   You might have to click on &#39;compare across forks&#39;.   image::images/compare.jpg[]   Select      * base repository: devonfw-tutorials     * base: main     * head repository: [your username]/tutorials     * compare: [your branch name]  and finally create the pull request by clicking on &#39;Create pull request&#39;.  Write &#39;WIP:&#39; in front of the pull request title to show that you are still working on this pull request. &#39;WIP&#39; stands for &#39;Work In Progress&#39;.  A workflow in the tutorials repository will build the tutorial. Currently the pipeline will fails because a tutorial must contain at least a title, a description and one step.  Let&#39;s fix that and fill the tutorial.        == Add the title  === Changing of the index.asciidoc file The syntax in which the tutorial is written can be found at https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.  At first we will add a title to the first line of the file.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor   To change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, asciidoc] ---- = Title of my new tutorial ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened index.asciidoc.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.    == Add the description  === Changing of the index.asciidoc file The next step is to add some description lines below the title. The description has to be surrounded by `====`.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor   To change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, asciidoc] ---- = Title of my new tutorial ==== In this section you can write the description of the tutorial. This can consist of several lines.  The description should explain the tutorial in a few words and explain what is to be learned. ====  ----   To replace the content with a specific placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file. The fastest way is to search through the opened file and replace *= Title of my new tutorial* with the new content.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.    == Add a step  === Changing of the index.asciidoc file Last but not least add a step.   Each step consists of  * an explanation * a function to execute (You can find a list with the currently available functions on https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler/wiki/Functions) * and an optional explanation of the results of the step.  In this tutorial we will add a simple step which creates a new file.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor   To change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, asciidoc] ---- = Title of my new tutorial ==== In this section you can write the description of the tutorial. This can consist of several lines.  The description should explain the tutorial in a few words and explain what is to be learned. ====  Before the '[step]' keyword the explanation is written. The explanation can consist of multiple lines. [step] -- createFile(\"pathToTheFile/fileName.txt\") -- ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened index.asciidoc.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.  This is the syntax without additional text after the step. There is an alternative syntax to display a text after the step (e.g. for describing the results of a step). This will be shown in the next step.   == Alternative syntax    If you want to add some additional text after the step to explain the results of a step then you have to use the following syntax.  ``` ==== The explanation for the step [step] -- functionName(parameters) -- The explanation of the results ==== ```  Here the whole block has to be surrounded by `====`.        == Push tutorial    You now have a working tutorial.  Push the changes again to GitHub by executing the following commands:  1. &#39;git add .&#39;  2. &#39;git commit -m &#34;added createFile step to the tutorial&#34;&#39; 3. &#39;git push&#39;  This will automatically start the workflow in the tutorials repository.  After a while you can find your tutorial on https://katacoda.com/devonfw-dev.  After you have completed your tutorial and tested it on the katacoda account, remove the &#39;WIP&#39; from your pull request to show that the tutorial is finished.        == Local testing    Now you should have a ideo how to create your own tutorials.  There is also a way to test your tutorials on your local machine. For this you have to clone the tutorial-compiler repository.  The directory with the tutorial-compiler has to be located next to the directory with the tutorials repository.  So go back to the root directory and clone the repository.  `cd /root`{{execute T1}}  `git clone https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler.git`{{execute T1}}  The tutorial-compiler needs typescript to be installed to work. So install typescript on your machine.  `npm install typescript -g`{{execute T1}}  Now navigate into the tutorial-compiler directory and install the needed dependencies.  `cd tutorial-compiler`{{execute T1}}  `npm install`{{execute T1}}   # Test your tutorial locally To run the tutorial-compiler execute the following command:  `bash localBuildRun.sh -e katacoda -p myTutorial`{{execute T1}}  This will execute your newly create tutorial in the &#39;katacoda&#39; environment. If you obmit the &#39;-e&#39; and &#39;-p&#39; paramter, all tutorials are executed in all environments.  The tutorial-compiler now generates the files needed for a katacoda tutorial. You can find the files in the &#39;build/output/katacoda/myTutorial&#39; directory of the tutorial compiler. The step you added to your tutorial is shown in the following file:  `tutorial-compiler/build/output/katacoda/myTutorial/step1.md`{{open}}        "

So go back to the root directory and clone the repository.  `cd /root`{{execute T1}}  `git clone https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler.git`{{execute T1}}  The tutorial-compiler needs typescript to be installed to work. So install typescript on your machine.  `npm install typescript -g`{{execute T1}}  Now navigate into the tutorial-compiler directory and install the needed dependencies.  `cd tutorial-compiler`{{execute T1}}  `npm install`{{execute T1}}   # Test your tutorial locally To run the tutorial-compiler execute the following command:  `bash localBuildRun.sh -e katacoda -p myTutorial`{{execute T1}}  This will execute your newly create tutorial in the &#39;katacoda&#39; environment. If you obmit the &#39;-e&#39; and &#39;-p&#39; paramter, all tutorials are executed in all environments.  The tutorial-compiler now generates the files needed for a katacoda tutorial. You can find the files in the &#39;build/output/katacoda/myTutorial&#39; directory of the tutorial compiler. The step you added to your tutorial is shown in the following file:  `tutorial-compiler/build/output/katacoda/myTutorial/step1.md`{{open}}        "

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.   The installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.      == Create a new devon4j project from command promt ### A devon4j Sample Application  Note: Startup script will take some time for set up. After that you can proceed further.  If you want to create devon4j application on your local machine there are two ways to do it:  * In eclipse as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-eclipse)  * Using command line as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-command-line)  Now, you will create sample devon4j application with name *sampleapp*. This step will guide you on how to do it.      ==== Prerequisites  In order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].  To create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.  ==== Create the project  Now you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.  `devon java create com.example.application.sampleapp`  There is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].  ==== What is generated?  The application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:  - *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.  - *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.  - *batch*: optional module for batch(es)  - *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.  - *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.  The toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:  - Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.  - Modules definition for the modules (described above)  - Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.  - Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration  - Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]  Once sampleapp is created switch to next tab of IDE. In IDE explorer you can see folder structure like devonfw-> workspaces->main->sampleapp .   Sampleapp contains 3 modules i.e api, core and server.  **api**: It contains API for sampleapp.The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be REST service interfaces, transfer-objects with their interfaces and datatypes but also OpenAPI or gRPC contracts.  **core**: It is the core of the application.In this module you can write actual business logic with service implementation, as well as entire logic layer and dataaccess layer.  **batch**: Optional module for batch layer. In this example we have not created it. To add batch module while generating from commandline use -Dbatch=batch parameter. And to generate it from eclipse using maven archetype, enter batch variable value as batch in project creation page.  **server**: This module bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) typically as a bootified WAR file.  If you want to know more about modules and project structure refer [here](#https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-structure.asciidoc#project-structure).   == devon4j multilayer architecture    image::images/devon4j_proj_structure1.jpg[]      As shown in above image, devon4j application follows [multilayered architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture).  Each component is divided into following layers:  * [client layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-client-layer.asciidoc) for the front-end (GUI).  * [service layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-service-layer.asciidoc) for the services used to expose functionality of the back-end to the client or other consumers. For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.service.impl will have all rest service implementation.  * [batch layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-batch-layer.asciidoc) for exposing functionality in batch-processes (e.g. mass imports).  * [logic layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-logic-layer.asciidoc) for the business logic. For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.logic will contain business logic or usecase implementation.  * [data-access layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc) for the data access (esp. persistence).For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.dataaccess will contain entity, repositories etc.   == Build the Java project with Maven Now you have to build a devon4j sample application i.e. sampleapp.     ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].  ==== Execution  Now move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/sampleapp` in the terminal. Next, use the following command to build the java project.  `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`  The maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state. Install will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.  We do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.   Once build is successful you will get bootified-war generated in server module target folder. In sampleapp check for path sampleapp/server/sampleapp-server-bootified.war     ## Conclusion  In this tutorial you have learnt how to create devon4j application using command line or via Eclipse. Next you can check for other tutorials such as:     * devon4j- contract first code generation     * devon4j-Kafka     * devon4j-security     * devon4j with Spring JPA     * devon4j rest services     "

If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.  ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed.

Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.       == Clone Repository ### Clone jump the queue repository  First, clone the Jump-The-Queue Repository.Jump the queue is a sample devonfw application.    ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. In this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.  After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue.git` in the terminal.  Once project is cloned switch to next tab of IDE. In IDE explorer you will be able to see folder structure like devonfw-> workspaces->main->jump-the-queue-> java->jtqj    == devon4j application architecture ### devon4j application structure    image::images/jtqj_app_structure.jpg[]      As shown above, jump-the-queue contains 3 modules i.e api, core and server.  **api**: It contains API for sampleapp.The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be REST service interfaces, transfer-objects with their interfaces and datatypes but also OpenAPI or gRPC contracts.  **core**: It is the core of the application.In this module you can write actual business logic with service implementation, as well as entire logic layer and dataaccess layer.  **batch**: optional module for batch layer. In this example we have not created it.  **server**: This module bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) typically as a bootified WAR file.  If you want to know more about modules and project structure refer [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-structure.asciidoc#project-structure).  devon4j application follows [multilayered architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture). We will understand more about it in next step.    == devon4j application layers ### devon4j layers explained     image::images/jtqj_detailed_app_structure.jpg[]      Above image display detailed structure of devon4j application. As shown above jump-the-queue application contains different components like queuemanagement, visitormanagement etc  Each component is divided into following layers: * [client layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-client-layer.asciidoc) for the front-end (GUI).  * [service layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-service-layer.asciidoc) for the services used to expose functionality of the back-end to the client or other consumers.  For example, in jtqj-api->queuemangement->service->api-> rest contains interfaces for rest services. In core module jtqj-core->queuemanagement->service->impl-> rest you will be able to see implementation of service.  * [batch layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-batch-layer.asciidoc) for exposing functionality in batch-processes (e.g. mass imports).  * [logic layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-logic-layer.asciidoc) for the business logic. For example, in jtqj-api->queuemangement->logic->api contains ETO(Entity Transfer Object) , CTO(Composite Transfer object), some logic interfaces. In core module jtqj-core->queuemanagement->logic->impl you will be able to see usecase implementation.  * [data-access layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc) for the data access (esp. persistence). For example, in jtqj-api->queuemangement->dataaccess->core contains entities, spring data repositories etc    == Understand devon4j application architecture    ### Key Principles: devon4j application follows some fundamental principles  for all decisions about architecture, design, or choosing standards, libraries, and frameworks.  It follows key principles such as KISS, open,patterns, solid. More detils can be found [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#key-principles).  ### Architecture Principles: Additionally devon4j architecture is based on [architecture principles](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#architecture-principles) such as Component Oriented Design, Homogeneity.  ### Application Architecture:  For the architecture of an application we distinguish the following views:  * The **Business Architecture** describes an application from the business perspective. It divides the application into business components and with full abstraction of technical aspects.  * The **Technical Architecture** describes an application from the technical implementation perspective. It divides the application into technical layers and defines which technical products and frameworks are used to support these layers.  * The **Infrastructure Architecture** describes an application from the operational infrastructure perspective. It defines the nodes used to run the application including clustering, load-balancing and networking. This view is not explored further in this guide.  Detailed description about devon4j business and technical architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#application-architecture)           ### Conclusion  To summarize, in this tutorial we learned about devon4j architecture and key principle it follows. with help of example we also learned about devon4j different modules such as api, core ,server and its multilayered architecture.  Next you can visit following tutorials to know more about devon4j:   * Java backend code generation using CobiGen (Code Generator)   * devon4j- contract first code generation   * devon4j-Kafka   * devon4j-security   * devon4j with Spring JPA   * devon4j rest services   "

This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.       == REST  === Create a new devon4j project from command promt REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an inter-operable protocol for services that is more lightweight than SOAP.\r \r For implementing REST services we use the JAX-RS standard. As an implementation we recommend CXF. For JSON bindings we use Jackson while XML binding works out-of-the-box with JAXB. To implement a service you write an interface with JAX-RS annotations for the API and a regular implementation class annotated with @Named to make it a spring-bean.\r \r The REST service implementation is a regular CDI bean that can use dependency injection. The separation of the API as a Java interface allows to use it for service client calls.\r \r **Why** **Should** **you** **prefer** **devon4j** **client** **over** **other** **clients?**\r \r devon4j supports flexible configuration, adding headers for authentication, mapping of errors from server, logging success/errors with duration for performance analysis, support for synchronous and asynchronous invocations. Easy invocation of service inside a micro-service.\r For more details on REST visit https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-rest.asciidoc\r \r For more details on devon4j Service Client https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-service-client.asciidoc\r \r ## Create the devon4j REST SERVER\r As explained in REST document, With JAX-RS it is important to make sure that each service method is annotated with the proper HTTP annotation(@GET, @POST, etc).\r Let's create devon4j server.\r      ==== Prerequisites  In order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].  To create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.  ==== Create the project  Now you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.  `devon java create com.example.application.httprestserver`  There is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].  ==== What is generated?  The application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:  - *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.  - *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.  - *batch*: optional module for batch(es)  - *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.  - *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.  The toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:  - Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.  - Modules definition for the modules (described above)  - Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.  - Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration  - Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]  In next step, you will add configuration to allow basic authentication.\r   == Add configuration to allow basic authentication  === Changing of the BaseWebSecurityConfig.java file Now, You have to modify BaseWebSecurityConfig file to allow application for basic authentication.\r      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of BaseWebSecurityConfig.java in any Editor   To change the file BaseWebSecurityConfig.java, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to BaseWebSecurityConfig.java and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/general/service/impl/config` and select the file `BaseWebSecurityConfig.java`.

Now, you have to start the build and then, start the server as mentioned below.\r      ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].  ==== Execution  Now move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver` in the terminal. Next, use the following command to build the java project.  `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`  The maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state. Install will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.  We do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.     === Run Java Server     === Prerequisites * Maven (can be included in your devonfw environment)  === Starting the server  First, change the current working directory to where your server is located, i.e. `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/server`.  Afterwards, use maven to start the server: `mvn spring-boot:run`. This command will start the Java server.    === Startup Assertion  You can check if the server is running correctly by checking if `localhost:8081/httprestserver` is accessible by either using a tool like `curl`, `Postman` or simply accessing the service via your webbrowser.  Example: `curl -Is localhost:8081/ | head -n 1`  This command should return an `200 OK` header if the service is available.    Once, Java server starts running. To test REST-server follow below steps:\r * Click on \"+\" next to terminal tab\r * Select \"select port to view host\"\r * Enter the port number \"8081\" \r * In the url, append \"/httprestserver/services/rest/visitormanagement/v1/clientrequest/\"\r * Enter username as \"admin\" and password as \"admin\"\r * You will be able to see response \"Welcome to REST API world\"\r In next step, You have to create devon4j service Client.\r   == Create devon4j REST Client  === Create a new devon4j project from command promt To create devon4j service Client. First, You need to create a sample devon4j project.\r \r      ==== Prerequisites  In order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].  To create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.  ==== Create the project  Now you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.  `devon java create com.example.application.httprestclient`  There is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].  ==== What is generated?  The application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:  - *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.  - *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.  - *batch*: optional module for batch(es)  - *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.  - *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.  The toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:  - Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.  - Modules definition for the modules (described above)  - Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.  - Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration  - Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]  Then, You need to add required dependency to your application.\r \r Since in this tutorial you will build client on Synchronous call so, you have to add dependency for synchronous consuming REST services via Apache CXF (Java8+)\r You will add below dependency in core folder pom.xml\r \r ----\r <dependency>\r   <groupId>com.devonfw.java.starters</groupId>\r   <artifactId>devon4j-starter-cxf-client-rest</artifactId>\r </dependency>\r \r ----\r   == Modify POM file  === Changing of the pom.xml file Modify pom.xml as below:\r      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor   To change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.

Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/impl/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `TestRestServiceImpl.java` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and TestRestServiceImpl.java has been created and filled with some data.   As you can see synchronous invocation of a service is very simple and type-safe. The actual call of showResponse will technically call the remote service(i.e. VisitormanagementRestService) over the wire ( via HTTP) including marshaling the arguments (converting String to JSON) and un-marshalling the result (e.g. converting the received JSON to String).\r Here in TestRestServiceImpl, there is a method \"callSynchronous\" which will call the VisitormanagementRestService and return the object of VisitormanagementRestService to visitormanagementRestService.\r With visitormanagementRestService, it is calling the method \"returnResponseToClient()\" of server.\r The response from server will be stored in \"resultFromAPICall\" as the return type of result is String.\r After getting response, you can handle the response further in your implementation. Here, you can see that response is getting handled in \"showResponse\" method.\r == Modify properties for server configuration  === Changing of the application.properties file An application needs to be configurable in order to allow internal setup but also to allow externalized configuration of a deployed package (e.g. integration into runtime environment). \r Now, You need to modify the content of existing properties files and add configuration for Server.\r      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of application.properties in any Editor   To change the file application.properties, you have to open it in any editor.

If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].  ==== Execution  Now move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient` in the terminal. Next, use the following command to build the java project.  `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`  The maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state. Install will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.  We do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.   * Once, application builds successfully. Open new terminal by clicking \"+\" and wait for it to load.\r * Now, Copy and execute below command to navigate into client server.\r   `cd devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/server`\r * Now, Copy and execute below command to start the application.\r   `devon mvn spring-boot:run`\r \r To test Synchronous method, follow below steps.\r * Click on \"+\" next to terminal tab\r * Select \"select port to view host\"\r * Enter the port number \"8080\" \r * In the url, append \"/httprestclient/services/rest/testrest/v1/response/\"\r * Enter username as \"admin\" and password as \"admin\"\r * You will be able to see response \"Welcome to REST API world\"\r    You have successfully created devon4j CXF REST Client.\r For more details on devon4j follow https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc.html\r  "

If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.  == devonfw setup    If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.  ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.       == REST  === Create a new devon4j project from command promt REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an inter-operable protocol for services that is more lightweight than SOAP.\r \r For implementing REST services we use the JAX-RS standard. As an implementation we recommend CXF. For JSON bindings we use Jackson while XML binding works out-of-the-box with JAXB. To implement a service you write an interface with JAX-RS annotations for the API and a regular implementation class annotated with @Named to make it a spring-bean.\r \r The REST service implementation is a regular CDI bean that can use dependency injection. The separation of the API as a Java interface allows to use it for service client calls.\r \r **Why** **Should** **you** **prefer** **devon4j** **client** **over** **other** **clients?**\r \r devon4j supports flexible configuration, adding headers for authentication, mapping of errors from server, logging success/errors with duration for performance analysis, support for synchronous and asynchronous invocations. Easy invocation of service inside a micro-service.\r For more details on REST visit https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-rest.asciidoc\r \r For more details on devon4j Service Client https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-service-client.asciidoc\r \r ## Create the devon4j REST SERVER\r As explained in REST document, With JAX-RS it is important to make sure that each service method is annotated with the proper HTTP annotation(@GET, @POST, etc).\r Let's create devon4j server.\r      ==== Prerequisites  In order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].  To create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.  ==== Create the project  Now you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.  `devon java create com.example.application.httprestserver`  There is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].  ==== What is generated?  The application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:  - *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.  - *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.  - *batch*: optional module for batch(es)  - *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.  - *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.  The toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:  - Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.  - Modules definition for the modules (described above)  - Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.  - Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration  - Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]  In next step, you will add configuration to allow basic authentication.\r   == Add configuration to allow basic authentication  === Changing of the BaseWebSecurityConfig.java file Now, You have to modify BaseWebSecurityConfig file to allow application for basic authentication.\r       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of BaseWebSecurityConfig.java in the VS Code Editor  To change the file BaseWebSecurityConfig.java, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to BaseWebSecurityConfig.java and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/general/service/impl/config` and select the file `BaseWebSecurityConfig.java`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and BaseWebSecurityConfig.java will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text.

Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/visitormanagement/service/api/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `VisitormanagementRestService.java` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and VisitormanagementRestService.java has been created and filled with some content.    == Create implementation class for Service  === Create the VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java file Now, you will create VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl, the implementation class of VisitormanagementRestService using JAX-RS standard.\r      ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Creating VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java in the VS Code Editor  Create VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it.   Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.   Copy the following text. [source, java] ---- package com.example.application.httprestserver.visitormanagement.service.impl.rest;\r \r import javax.inject.Named;\r \r import com.example.application.httprestserver.visitormanagement.service.api.rest.VisitormanagementRestService;\r \r @Named(\"VisitormanagementRestService\")\r public class VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl implements VisitormanagementRestService {\r \r   @Override\r   public String returnResponseToClient() {\r \r     return \"Welcome to REST API world\";\r   }\r \r }\r  ----  Now insert the copied text into the new file.  The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/visitormanagement/service/impl/rest/VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java*.  Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/visitormanagement/service/impl/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java has been created and filled with some content.  Here , you can see \"VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java\" is annotated with @Named to make it a spring-bean. To get return response to client \"returnResponseToClient()\" can be accessed via HTTP GET under the URL path \"/visitormanagement/v1/clientrequest\". It will return its result (String) as JSON (see @Produces in VisitormanagementRestService).\r   == Modify properties files  === Changing of the application.properties file Now, you will configure port in application properties.\r       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of application.properties in the VS Code Editor  To change the file application.properties, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to application.properties and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/core/src/main/resources` and select the file `application.properties`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and application.properties will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- # This is the configuration file shipped with the application that contains reasonable defaults.\r # Environment specific configurations are configured in config/application.properties.\r # If you are running in a servlet container you may add this to lib/config/application.properties in case you do not\r # want to touch the WAR file.\r \r server.port=8081\r server.servlet.context-path=/httprestserver\r spring.application.name=httprestserver\r \r security.expose.error.details=false\r \r spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate\r \r # Datasource for accessing the database\r # https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/d3c34ee3d1bfd3db4a98678c524e145ef9bca51c/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/jdbc/DatabaseDriver.java\r spring.jpa.database=h2\r # spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect\r # spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver\r spring.datasource.username=sa\r \r # Hibernate NamingStrategy has been deprecated and then removed in favor of two step naming strategy ImplicitNamingStrategy and PhysicalNamingStrategy\r spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.implicit-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyJpaCompliantImpl\r spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl\r \r # https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/issues/65\r # https://vladmihalcea.com/the-open-session-in-view-anti-pattern/\r spring.jpa.open-in-view=false\r \r # to prevent that Spring Boot launches batch jobs on startup\r # might otherwise lead to errors if job parameters are needed (or lead to unwanted modifications and longer startup times)\r # see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22318907/how-to-stop-spring-batch-scheduled-jobs-from-running-at-first-time-when-executin\r spring.batch.job.enabled=false\r \r # Flyway for Database Setup and Migrations\r spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration\r \r  ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened application.properties.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and application.properties has been changed.    === Changing of the application.properties file     ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of application.properties in the VS Code Editor  To change the file application.properties, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to application.properties and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/core/src/main/resources/config` and select the file `application.properties`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and application.properties will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- # This is the spring boot configuration file for development. It will not be included into the application.\r # In order to set specific configurations in a regular installed environment create an according file\r # config/application.properties in the server.

The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and application.properties has been changed.    == Build and Start devon4j REST Server  === Build the Java project with Maven You have successfully built the REST-server. Now, you have to start the build and then, start the server as mentioned below.\r      ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].  ==== Execution  Now move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver` in the terminal. Next, use the following command to build the java project.  `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`  The maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state. Install will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.  We do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.     === Run Java Server     === Prerequisites * Maven (can be included in your devonfw environment)  === Starting the server  First, change the current working directory to where your server is located, i.e. `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/server`.  Afterwards, use maven to start the server: `mvn spring-boot:run`. This command will start the Java server.    === Startup Assertion  You can check if the server is running correctly by checking if `localhost:8081/httprestserver` is accessible by either using a tool like `curl`, `Postman` or simply accessing the service via your webbrowser.  Example: `curl -Is localhost:8081/ | head -n 1`  This command should return an `200 OK` header if the service is available.    Once, Java server starts running. To test REST-server follow below steps:\r * Click on \"+\" next to terminal tab\r * Select \"select port to view host\"\r * Enter the port number \"8081\" \r * In the url, append \"/httprestserver/services/rest/visitormanagement/v1/clientrequest/\"\r * Enter username as \"admin\" and password as \"admin\"\r * You will be able to see response \"Welcome to REST API world\"\r In next step, You have to create devon4j service Client.\r   == Create devon4j REST Client  === Create a new devon4j project from command promt To create devon4j service Client. First, You need to create a sample devon4j project.\r \r      ==== Prerequisites  In order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].  To create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.  ==== Create the project  Now you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.  `devon java create com.example.application.httprestclient`  There is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].  ==== What is generated?  The application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:  - *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.  - *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.  - *batch*: optional module for batch(es)  - *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.  - *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.  The toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:  - Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.  - Modules definition for the modules (described above)  - Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.  - Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration  - Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]  Then, You need to add required dependency to your application.\r \r Since in this tutorial you will build client on Synchronous call so, you have to add dependency for synchronous consuming REST services via Apache CXF (Java8+)\r You will add below dependency in core folder pom.xml\r \r ----\r <dependency>\r   <groupId>com.devonfw.java.starters</groupId>\r   <artifactId>devon4j-starter-cxf-client-rest</artifactId>\r </dependency>\r \r ----\r   == Modify POM file  === Changing of the pom.xml file Modify pom.xml as below:\r       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of pom.xml in the VS Code Editor  To change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core` and select the file `pom.xml`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and pom.xml will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <dependencies> <dependency>   <groupId>com.devonfw.java.starters</groupId>   <artifactId>devon4j-starter-cxf-client-rest</artifactId> </dependency>   ----  To replace the content with a specific placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file. The fastest way is to search through the opened file and replace *&lt;dependencies&gt;* with the new content.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.    == Create service to invoke server  === Create the VisitormanagementRestService.java file Now, You will create a Java interface VisitormanagementRestService to invoke inside client.\r      ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Creating VisitormanagementRestService.java in the VS Code Editor  Create VisitormanagementRestService.java in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it.   Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.   Copy the following text. [source, java] ---- package com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest;\r \r import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;\r import javax.ws.rs.GET;\r import javax.ws.rs.Path;\r import javax.ws.rs.Produces;\r import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\r \r @Path(\"/visitormanagement/v1\")\r @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r public interface VisitormanagementRestService {\r \r   @GET\r   @Path(\"/clientrequest/\")\r   @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r   @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r   public String returnResponseToClient();\r \r } ----  Now insert the copied text into the new file.  The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest/VisitormanagementRestService.java*.  Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `VisitormanagementRestService.java` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and VisitormanagementRestService.java has been created and filled with some content.    == Create service for CXF REST Client  === Create the TestRestService.java file Now, you will create service for client i.e. TestRestService.java to provide functionality using JAX-RS standard.\r      ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Creating TestRestService.java in the VS Code Editor  Create TestRestService.java in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it.   Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n.

The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest/TestRestService.java*.  Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `TestRestService.java` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and TestRestService.java has been created and filled with some content.    == Create implementation class for client&#39;s service  === Create the TestRestServiceImpl.java file Now, you will create TestRestServiceImpl, the implementation class of TestRestService using JAX-RS standard.\r \r      ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Creating TestRestServiceImpl.java in the VS Code Editor  Create TestRestServiceImpl.java in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it.   Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.   Copy the following text. [source, java] ---- package com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.impl.rest;  import javax.inject.Inject; import javax.inject.Named;  import com.devonfw.module.service.common.api.client.ServiceClientFactory; import com.devonfw.module.service.common.api.client.config.ServiceClientConfigBuilder; import com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest.TestRestService; import com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest.VisitormanagementRestService;  @Named(\"TestRestService\") public class TestRestServiceImpl implements TestRestService {    @Inject   private ServiceClientFactory serviceClientFactory;    @Override   public String showResponse() {      String result = callSynchronous();     System.out.println(\"**********inside client method***********\");     System.out.println(result);     System.out.println(\"************Thank you for choosing devon4j ****************\");     return result;    }    private String callSynchronous() {      System.out.println(\"***********inside synchronous call************\");     VisitormanagementRestService visitormanagementRestService = this.serviceClientFactory.create(         VisitormanagementRestService.class,         new ServiceClientConfigBuilder().authBasic().userLogin(\"admin\").userPassword(\"admin\").buildMap());     // call of service over the wire, synchronously blocking until result is received or error occurred     String resultFromAPICall = visitormanagementRestService.returnResponseToClient();     System.out.println(\"************************got result from api\" + resultFromAPICall + \"***************\");     return resultFromAPICall;   }    @Override   public String verifyServiceWork() {      return \"Verified... service is working\";   }  }  ----  Now insert the copied text into the new file.  The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/impl/rest/TestRestServiceImpl.java*.  Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/impl/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `TestRestServiceImpl.java` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and TestRestServiceImpl.java has been created and filled with some content.  As you can see synchronous invocation of a service is very simple and type-safe. The actual call of showResponse will technically call the remote service(i.e. VisitormanagementRestService) over the wire ( via HTTP) including marshaling the arguments (converting String to JSON) and un-marshalling the result (e.g. converting the received JSON to String).\r Here in TestRestServiceImpl, there is a method \"callSynchronous\" which will call the VisitormanagementRestService and return the object of VisitormanagementRestService to visitormanagementRestService.\r With visitormanagementRestService, it is calling the method \"returnResponseToClient()\" of server.\r The response from server will be stored in \"resultFromAPICall\" as the return type of result is String.\r After getting response, you can handle the response further in your implementation. Here, you can see that response is getting handled in \"showResponse\" method.\r   == Modify properties for server configuration  === Changing of the application.properties file An application needs to be configurable in order to allow internal setup but also to allow externalized configuration of a deployed package (e.g. integration into runtime environment). \r Now, You need to modify the content of existing properties files and add configuration for Server.\r       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of application.properties in the VS Code Editor  To change the file application.properties, you have to open it in VS Code first.

If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].  ==== Execution  Now move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient` in the terminal. Next, use the following command to build the java project.  `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`  The maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state. Install will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.  We do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.   * Once, application builds successfully. Open new terminal by clicking \"+\" and wait for it to load.\r * Now, Copy and execute below command to navigate into client server.\r   `cd devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/server`\r * Now, Copy and execute below command to start the application.\r   `devon mvn spring-boot:run`\r \r To test Synchronous method, follow below steps.\r * Click on \"+\" next to terminal tab\r * Select \"select port to view host\"\r * Enter the port number \"8080\" \r * In the url, append \"/httprestclient/services/rest/testrest/v1/response/\"\r * Enter username as \"admin\" and password as \"admin\"\r * You will be able to see response \"Welcome to REST API world\"\r    You have successfully created devon4j CXF REST Client.\r For more details on devon4j follow https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc.html\r  "

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].

On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.        ## Conclusion\r You have successfully migrated the sample project from an older version to the latest version using command line!!\r \r For more details on devon4j java commands for various functionalities and the arguments (devon java «args») follow \r https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-usage.asciidoc.html#java.asciidoc\r  "

Primarily the term used is **module** instead of **component**. To clarify this:  * A **component** describes an UI element containing HTML, CSS and JavaScript - structure, design and logic encapsulated inside a reusable container called component.  * A **module** describes an applications feature area. The application flight-app may have a module called booking.  An application developed using Angular consists of multiple modules. There are feature modules and special modules - *core* and *shared*. Angular or Angular Styleguide give no guidance on how to structure a module internally. This is where this architecture comes in.  We will refer a devon4ng application for better understanding. But before that, let us understand the Architectural Layers of a devon4ng application.        == Architectural Layers    image::images/architecture-layers.png[]  The architecture describes two layers:  * [Components Layer](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#components-layer.asciidoc) encapsulates components which present the current application state. Components are separated into [Smart and Dumb Components](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#components-layer.asciidoc_smart-and-dumb-components). The only logic present is view logic inside Smart Components.  * [Services Layer](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#services-layer.asciidoc) is more or less what we call &#39;business logic layer&#39; on the server side. The layer defines the applications state, the transitions between state and classic business logic. Stores contain application state over time to which Smart Components subscribe to. Adapters are used to perform XHRs, WebSocket connections, etc. The business model is described inside the module. Use case services perform business logic needed for use cases. A use case services interacts with the store and adapters. Methods of use case services are the API for Smart Components. Those methods are Actions in reactive terminology.  Let us refer the application to understand the above concepts.        === Architectural Layers explained    The application you see here is a clone of devon4ng-application-template. You can find it [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template)  The `SampleDataModule` is a nice example of the different layers explained. It holds some components (representing the *components* layer) and also has a `SampleDataService` (representing the *service* layer) which is imported in the required components.  The service acts as the adapter element explained earlier (used to make XHR calls).         == Modules    image::images/architecture-modules.png[]  Every Angular application requires a module called app which is the main entrance to an application at runtime - this module gets bootstrapped. Angular Styleguide defines feature modules and two special modules - core and shared.  * A **feature** module is basically a vertical cut through both layers.  * The **shared** module consists of components shared across feature modules.  * The **core** module holds services shared across modules.  So core module is a module only having a services layer and shared module is a module only having a components layer.  The `SampleDataModule` which we visitied earlier is a typical example of a **feature** module  Let us refer the application again for examples on **core** module and **shared** module.        == Core module    In the `CoreModule`, you can see services like `TranslocoRootModule` (translation service), `HttpRequestInterceptorService` (HTTP interceptor sesrvice) and Angular Material related modules being part of this core module. This core module is then imported into every other module as the services are used throughout the application.         == Shared module    In the `LayoutModule`, you can see components like `NavBar` and `Header` being part of this module. This module is comparable to a **shared** module which holds common components used throughout the application. The shared module is imported into other (feature) modules where the common components will be used.  You can study in more detail about Angular architecture by following [this document](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_devonfw-reference-client-architecture).          Conclusion  To conclude, in this tutorial you learned   * the concepts of modules and components  * the layers of the architecture - components and services  * the different types of modules - core, shared and feature  Then we referred a devon4ng application by cloning it and traversing through its files. You can study in more detail about Angular architecture by following [this document](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_devonfw-reference-client-architecture).  The idea with devon4ng is to define an architecture which is a compromise between, on the one hand, leveraging the best practices and latest trends like reactive style development, on the other hand, providing a short onboarding time while still using an architecture that helps us scale and be productive at the same time.

If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.  == devonfw setup    If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.  ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.       === Run a setup script    Run a Script to setup the enviroment for the Tutorial.    ==== Prerequisites * Any Editor that can edit files.  ==== Create the Setupscript Open a editor and create a new file by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.  .Operating system .

Linux and macOS +  Open the Terminal in your current workspace and execute the command `bash cloneProject.sh` to run the script.    == Overview    An Angular application is component based like [devon4j](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j), but different terminology is used as compared to devon4j. Primarily the term used is **module** instead of **component**. To clarify this:  * A **component** describes an UI element containing HTML, CSS and JavaScript - structure, design and logic encapsulated inside a reusable container called component.  * A **module** describes an applications feature area. The application flight-app may have a module called booking.  An application developed using Angular consists of multiple modules. There are feature modules and special modules - *core* and *shared*. Angular or Angular Styleguide give no guidance on how to structure a module internally. This is where this architecture comes in.  We will refer a devon4ng application for better understanding. But before that, let us understand the Architectural Layers of a devon4ng application.        == Architectural Layers    image::images/architecture-layers.png[]  The architecture describes two layers:  * [Components Layer](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#components-layer.asciidoc) encapsulates components which present the current application state. Components are separated into [Smart and Dumb Components](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#components-layer.asciidoc_smart-and-dumb-components). The only logic present is view logic inside Smart Components.  * [Services Layer](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#services-layer.asciidoc) is more or less what we call &#39;business logic layer&#39; on the server side. The layer defines the applications state, the transitions between state and classic business logic. Stores contain application state over time to which Smart Components subscribe to. Adapters are used to perform XHRs, WebSocket connections, etc. The business model is described inside the module. Use case services perform business logic needed for use cases. A use case services interacts with the store and adapters. Methods of use case services are the API for Smart Components. Those methods are Actions in reactive terminology.  Let us refer the application to understand the above concepts.        === Architectural Layers explained    The application you see here is a clone of devon4ng-application-template. You can find it [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template)  The `SampleDataModule` is a nice example of the different layers explained. It holds some components (representing the *components* layer) and also has a `SampleDataService` (representing the *service* layer) which is imported in the required components.  The service acts as the adapter element explained earlier (used to make XHR calls).         == Modules    image::images/architecture-modules.png[]  Every Angular application requires a module called app which is the main entrance to an application at runtime - this module gets bootstrapped. Angular Styleguide defines feature modules and two special modules - core and shared.  * A **feature** module is basically a vertical cut through both layers.  * The **shared** module consists of components shared across feature modules.  * The **core** module holds services shared across modules.  So core module is a module only having a services layer and shared module is a module only having a components layer.  The `SampleDataModule` which we visitied earlier is a typical example of a **feature** module  Let us refer the application again for examples on **core** module and **shared** module.        == Core module    In the `CoreModule`, you can see services like `TranslocoRootModule` (translation service), `HttpRequestInterceptorService` (HTTP interceptor sesrvice) and Angular Material related modules being part of this core module. This core module is then imported into every other module as the services are used throughout the application.         == Shared module    In the `LayoutModule`, you can see components like `NavBar` and `Header` being part of this module. This module is comparable to a **shared** module which holds common components used throughout the application. The shared module is imported into other (feature) modules where the common components will be used.  You can study in more detail about Angular architecture by following [this document](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_devonfw-reference-client-architecture).          Conclusion  To conclude, in this tutorial you learned   * the concepts of modules and components  * the layers of the architecture - components and services  * the different types of modules - core, shared and feature  Then we referred a devon4ng application by cloning it and traversing through its files. You can study in more detail about Angular architecture by following [this document](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_devonfw-reference-client-architecture).  The idea with devon4ng is to define an architecture which is a compromise between, on the one hand, leveraging the best practices and latest trends like reactive style development, on the other hand, providing a short onboarding time while still using an architecture that helps us scale and be productive at the same time.

        "body": "= Boost Angular’s Performance by Lazy Loading your Modules with devon4ng  == Learn how to defer initialization of modules in Angular until it is needed   In single-page-applications as the application size increases its loading speed decreases (since typically the entire application is loaded at once). Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers initialization of objects until it is needed. Angular handles lazy loading through the routing module which redirects to requested pages. Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand. In this tutorial you will build a simple app to understand how lazyloading is implemented in Angular.  ## Prerequisites  * Basic Angular knowledge  ## Learning goals In this tutorial you will learn how to:  * create an Angular application using the devon command  * look how all modules are loaded by an application at the begining (eager loading)  * implement lazy loading and understand its concept and advantages    The definition of each step of this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/tree/main/devon4ng-lazy-loading/.

Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.component.html will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <router-outlet></router-outlet> ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.    == Create the modules and their components  === Create the first-routing.module.ts file Next you will create the feature modules and components for the app. You will follow the structure shown in the image in the first step. You can use the CLI command `devon ng generate module` along with the `--routing` flag to generate the modules, and `devon ng generate component` command to generate the components.       ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file.

You can refer the image in the first step to understand how you will configure the routes. In `app-routing.module.ts` you will add a path 'first' to `FirstComponent` and a redirection from '' to 'first'. And then import the `FirstModule` in the main `app.module.ts`  Next, for the feature modules, you will add the routes 'first/second-left' and 'first/second-right' pointing to their respective `ContentComponent` in `first-routing.module.ts`. And then import `SecondLeftModule` and `SecondRightModule` in `first.module.ts`      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in any Editor   To change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor.

The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first.module.ts has been changed.    == Eager loading vs Lazy Loading  === Changing of the app-routing.module.ts file If you run the project at this point you can see in the terminal that just the main file is built. ![compile-eager](./assets/compile-eager.png)  Go to port 4200 and check the Network tab in the Developer Tools. We can see a document named \"first\" is loaded. If you click on [Go to right module] a second level module opens, but there is no 'second-right' document. ![second-lvl-right-eager](./assets/second-lvl-right-eager.png)  Now we will modify the app to lazily load the modules. Modifying an angular application to load its modules lazily is easy, you have to change the routing configuration of the desired module (for example `FirstModule`). Instead of loading a component, you dynamically import it in a `loadChildren` attribute because modules acts as gates to access components \"inside\" them. Updating this app to load lazily has four consecuences: no component attribute, no import of `FirstComponent`, `FirstModule` import has to be removed from the imports array at `app.module.ts`, and change of context.  Also, in `first-routing.module.ts` you can change the path for the `ContentComponent`s from `first/second-left` and `first/second-right` to simply `second-left` and `second-right` respectively,  because it aquires the context set by AppRoutingModule.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in any Editor   To change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor.

The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first-routing.module.ts has been changed.    == Lazily load the second left module  === Changing of the first-routing.module.ts file Now when you check the terminal running the app, you could see the lazy loaded modules getting generated along with the main bundle. Also, if you check the Network tab in the developer tools, you could see the (lazy) modules getting loaded when needed. Since, `FirstModule` is the first path we visit, it is getting loaded at first only. ![compile-first-lazy](./assets/compile-first-lazy.png) ![first-lvl-lazy](./assets/first-lvl-lazy.png)  Now, lets make the SecondLeftModule load lazily. For this, you need to change `component` to `loadChildren` and refer `SecondLeftModule` in the file `first-routing.module.ts`. Next, you need to remove `SecondLeftModule` from the `imports` array of `first.module.ts`. After that you need to route the `ContentComponent` within the `second-left-routing.module.ts`.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of first-routing.module.ts in any Editor   To change the file first-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.

        "body": "= Boost Angular’s Performance by Lazy Loading your Modules with devon4ng  == Learn how to defer initialization of modules in Angular until it is needed   In single-page-applications as the application size increases its loading speed decreases (since typically the entire application is loaded at once). Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers initialization of objects until it is needed. Angular handles lazy loading through the routing module which redirects to requested pages. Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand. In this tutorial you will build a simple app to understand how lazyloading is implemented in Angular.  ## Prerequisites  * Basic Angular knowledge  ## Learning goals In this tutorial you will learn how to:  * create an Angular application using the devon command  * look how all modules are loaded by an application at the begining (eager loading)  * implement lazy loading and understand its concept and advantages    The definition of each step of this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/tree/main/devon4ng-lazy-loading/.   Feel free to report any errors to us or fix them yourself. Errors can be reported by creating an issue in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/issues[tutorials repository]. To fix the error fork the repository and create a pull request. Errors in the wiki can be reported and fixed in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler[Tutorial-compiler repository]. You can find a description of what to look for when creating a pull request at the devonfw contribution guide: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/community/community.html#community.asciidoc_contributing-to-devonfw. If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.  == devonfw setup    If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.  ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.       == Enable routing with router-outlet  === Changing of the app.component.html file In the file app.component.html delete all the content and put in the `router-outlet` tag.       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor  To change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <router-outlet></router-outlet> ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.    == Create the modules and their components  === Create the first-routing.module.ts file Next you will create the feature modules and components for the app. You will follow the structure shown in the image in the first step. You can use the CLI command `devon ng generate module` along with the `--routing` flag to generate the modules, and `devon ng generate component` command to generate the components.      ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Creating first-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor  Create first-routing.module.ts in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it.   Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n.

You can refer the image in the first step to understand how you will configure the routes. In `app-routing.module.ts` you will add a path 'first' to `FirstComponent` and a redirection from '' to 'first'. And then import the `FirstModule` in the main `app.module.ts`  Next, for the feature modules, you will add the routes 'first/second-left' and 'first/second-right' pointing to their respective `ContentComponent` in `first-routing.module.ts`. And then import `SecondLeftModule` and `SecondRightModule` in `first.module.ts`       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor  To change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first.

[source, ] ---- import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';  import { FirstRoutingModule } from './first-routing.module'; import { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component';  import { SecondLeftModule } from './second-left/second-left.module'; import { SecondRightModule } from './second-right/second-right.module';  @NgModule({   declarations: [FirstComponent],   imports: [     CommonModule,     FirstRoutingModule,     SecondLeftModule,     SecondRightModule,   ] }) export class FirstModule { }  ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened first.module.ts.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first.module.ts has been changed.    == Eager loading vs Lazy Loading  === Changing of the app-routing.module.ts file If you run the project at this point you can see in the terminal that just the main file is built. ![compile-eager](./assets/compile-eager.png)  Go to port 4200 and check the Network tab in the Developer Tools. We can see a document named \"first\" is loaded. If you click on [Go to right module] a second level module opens, but there is no 'second-right' document. ![second-lvl-right-eager](./assets/second-lvl-right-eager.png)  Now we will modify the app to lazily load the modules. Modifying an angular application to load its modules lazily is easy, you have to change the routing configuration of the desired module (for example `FirstModule`). Instead of loading a component, you dynamically import it in a `loadChildren` attribute because modules acts as gates to access components \"inside\" them. Updating this app to load lazily has four consecuences: no component attribute, no import of `FirstComponent`, `FirstModule` import has to be removed from the imports array at `app.module.ts`, and change of context.  Also, in `first-routing.module.ts` you can change the path for the `ContentComponent`s from `first/second-left` and `first/second-right` to simply `second-left` and `second-right` respectively,  because it aquires the context set by AppRoutingModule.       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor  To change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first.

The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first-routing.module.ts has been changed.    == Lazily load the second left module  === Changing of the first-routing.module.ts file Now when you check the terminal running the app, you could see the lazy loaded modules getting generated along with the main bundle. Also, if you check the Network tab in the developer tools, you could see the (lazy) modules getting loaded when needed. Since, `FirstModule` is the first path we visit, it is getting loaded at first only. ![compile-first-lazy](./assets/compile-first-lazy.png) ![first-lvl-lazy](./assets/first-lvl-lazy.png)  Now, lets make the SecondLeftModule load lazily. For this, you need to change `component` to `loadChildren` and refer `SecondLeftModule` in the file `first-routing.module.ts`. Next, you need to remove `SecondLeftModule` from the `imports` array of `first.module.ts`. After that you need to route the `ContentComponent` within the `second-left-routing.module.ts`.       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of first-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor  To change the file first-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first.

Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to first.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app/first` and select the file `first.module.ts`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and first.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';  import { FirstRoutingModule } from './first-routing.module'; import { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component';  import { SecondRightModule } from './second-right/second-right.module';  @NgModule({   declarations: [FirstComponent],   imports: [     CommonModule,     FirstRoutingModule,     SecondRightModule,   ] }) export class FirstModule { }  ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened first.module.ts.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first.module.ts has been changed.    === Changing of the second-left-routing.module.ts file     ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of second-left-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor  To change the file second-left-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to second-left-routing.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app/first/second-left` and select the file `second-left-routing.module.ts`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and second-left-routing.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router'; import { ContentComponent } from './content/content.component';  const routes: Routes = [   {     path: '',     component: ContentComponent   } ];  @NgModule({   imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],   exports: [RouterModule] }) export class SecondLeftRoutingModule { }  ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened second-left-routing.module.ts.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and second-left-routing.module.ts has been changed.  If you now check the terminal, you could also see `second-left-second-left-module` along with the `first-first-module` and the `main` bundle getting generated.  ![second-lvl-lazy](./assets/second-lvl-lazy.png)  Also, in the Network tab of the developer tools, you could see the `second-left-second-left-module.js` is only loading when we click on the [Go to left module] button ![second-lvl-left-lazy](./assets/second-lvl-left-lazy.png)    Lazy loading is a pattern useful when new features are added, these features are usually identified as modules which can be loaded only if needed as shown in this tutorial, reducing the time spent loading an application.

If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.  == devonfw setup    If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.  ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.       == Add Angular Material  === Installation of package @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations Next you will add Angular Material to your application.      ==== Prerequisites  * Install Node.js. You can download Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/[here]. * Installed npm. You can download npm https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm[here] and follow the installation instructions.  ==== Execution  You can install the package @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations and add it to the dependencies.  Now execute `npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations` in the terminal.   This may take some time.    == Import Material components  === Changing of the app.module.ts file Once the dependencies are installed, you need to import the BrowserAnimationsModule in your AppModule for animations support. Also, Angular Material provides a host of components for designing your application. All the components are well structured into NgModules. For each component from the Angular Material library that you want to use, you have to import the respective NgModule.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app.module.ts in any Editor   To change the file app.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.module.ts and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.module.ts`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.module.ts will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations'; import { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon'; import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button'; import { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu'; import { MatListModule } from '@angular/material/list'; import { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar'; import { MatSidenavModule } from '@angular/material/sidenav'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';  import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component';  @NgModule({   declarations: [     AppComponent   ],   imports: [     BrowserAnimationsModule,     MatIconModule,     MatButtonModule,     MatMenuModule,     MatListModule,     MatToolbarModule,     MatSidenavModule,     AppRoutingModule   ],   providers: [],   bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }  ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app.module.ts.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.module.ts has been changed.    == Load Material icons  === Changing of the index.html file To use Material Design Icons along with the mat-icon component, you will load the Material Icons library in your `src/index.html` file.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of index.html in any Editor   To change the file index.html, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.html and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src` and select the file `index.html`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.html will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, html] ---- <!doctype html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head>   <meta charset=\"utf-8\">   <title>Devon4ngMatLayout</title>   <base href=\"/\">   <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">   <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\" rel=\"stylesheet\">   <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\"> </head> <body>   <app-root></app-root> </body> </html>  ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened index.html.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.html has been changed.    == Add global styles  === Changing of the styles.scss file Now that you have all the Angular Material related dependencies set up in your project, you can start coding. Let’s begin by adding a suitable `margin` and `font` to the body element of your single page application. You will add it in the `src/styles.scss` file to apply it globally.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of styles.scss in any Editor   To change the file styles.scss, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to styles.scss and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src` and select the file `styles.scss`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner styles.scss will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, css] ---- @import \"~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\";  body {     margin: 0;     font-family: \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, sans-serif;   } ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened styles.scss.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and styles.scss has been changed.    == Add a header  === Changing of the app.component.html file Clear the `app.component.html` file and setup a header with a menu button and some navigational links. You will use `mat-toolbar`, `mat-button`, `mat-menu`, `mat-icon` and `mat-icon-button` for this:      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app.component.html in any Editor   To change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.component.html will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">   <button mat-icon-button aria-label=\"menu\" class=\"menu\">     <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>   </button>   <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu\">Menu 1</button>   <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>   <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>    <mat-menu #submenu=\"matMenu\">     <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>     <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu2\">Sub-menu 2</button>   </mat-menu>    <mat-menu #submenu2=\"matMenu\">     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 2</button>     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 3</button>   </mat-menu>  </mat-toolbar> ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.  The color attribute on the mat-toolbar element will give it the primary (indigo) color as defined by your theme. The color attribute works with most Angular Material components; the possible values are `primary`, `accent` and `warn`. The `mat-toolbar` is a suitable component to represent a header. It serves as a placeholder for elements you want in your header. Inside the `mat-toolbar`, you start with a button having `mat-icon-button` attribute, which itself contains a `mat-icon` element having the value `menu`. This will serve as a menu button which you can use to toggle the `sidenav`. You follow it with some sample buttons having the `mat-button` attribute. Notice the first button has a property `matMenuTriggerFor` binded to a local reference submenu. As the property name suggests, the click of this button will display the mat-menu element with the specified local reference as a drop-down menu. The rest of the code is self explanatory.   == Shift header menu buttons to right  === Changing of the app.component.scss file You want to keep the sidenav toggling menu button on the left and move the rest to the right to make it look better. To do this add the following style to the `menu` class in `app.component.scss`:      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app.component.scss in any Editor   To change the file app.component.scss, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.scss and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.scss`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.component.scss will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- .menu {     margin-right: auto; } ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.scss.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.scss has been changed.    == Create navigatable pages  === Create the home.component.html file Next, you will create a sidenav. But before that lets create a couple of components to navigate between, the links of which you will add to the sidenav. You can use the `ng generate component` (or `ng g c` command for short) to create Home and Data components. But here, you will create them manually. You nest them in the `pages` sub-directory since they represent your pages. And you will also add the new components to your AppModule.       ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * Any Editor that can edit files  ==== Creating home.component.html in any Editor  Create home.component.html in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .  Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work. The editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.   Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <h2>Home Page</h2>  ----  Now insert the copied text into the new file.  The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home/home.component.html*.  Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `home.component.html` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and home.component.html has been created and filled with some data.   === Create the home.component.scss file     ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * Any Editor that can edit files  ==== Creating home.component.scss in any Editor  Create home.component.scss in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .

Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `home.component.scss` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and home.component.scss has been created and filled with some data.   === Create the home.component.ts file     ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * Any Editor that can edit files  ==== Creating home.component.ts in any Editor  Create home.component.ts in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .  Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.

[source, ] ---- import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations'; import { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon'; import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button'; import { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu'; import { MatListModule } from '@angular/material/list'; import { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar'; import { MatSidenavModule } from '@angular/material/sidenav'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';  import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; import { HomeComponent } from './pages/home/home.component'; import { DataComponent } from './pages/data/data.component';  @NgModule({   declarations: [     AppComponent,     HomeComponent,     DataComponent   ],   imports: [     BrowserAnimationsModule,     MatIconModule,     MatButtonModule,     MatMenuModule,     MatListModule,     MatToolbarModule,     MatSidenavModule,     AppRoutingModule   ],   providers: [],   bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }  ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app.module.ts.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.module.ts has been changed.    == Add routing  === Changing of the app-routing.module.ts file Let us set up the routing such that when you visit the root url you see the `HomeComponent` and when you visit `/data` url you see the `DataComponent`. You had opted for routing while creating the application, so you have the routing module `app-routing.module.ts` setup for us. In this file, you have the empty routes array where you set up your routes:      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in any Editor   To change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app-routing.module.ts and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app-routing.module.ts`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app-routing.module.ts will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router'; import { HomeComponent } from './pages/home/home.component'; import { DataComponent } from './pages/data/data.component';  const routes: Routes = [   { path: '', component: HomeComponent },   { path: 'data', component: DataComponent } ];  @NgModule({   imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],   exports: [RouterModule] }) export class AppRoutingModule { }  ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app-routing.module.ts.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app-routing.module.ts has been changed.    == Changing of the app.component.html file You need to provide a hook where the components will be loaded when their respective URLs are loaded. You do that by using the `router-outlet` directive in the `app.component.html`:    ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app.component.html in any Editor   To change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.component.html will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">   <button mat-icon-button aria-label=\"menu\" class=\"menu\">     <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>   </button>   <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu\">Menu 1</button>   <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>   <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>    <mat-menu #submenu=\"matMenu\">     <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>     <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu2\">Sub-menu 2</button>   </mat-menu>    <mat-menu #submenu2=\"matMenu\">     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 2</button>     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 3</button>   </mat-menu>  </mat-toolbar> <router-outlet></router-outlet> ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.    == Create the sidenav  === Changing of the app.component.html file Let us finally create the sidenav. To implement the sidenav you need to use 3 Angular Material components: `mat-sidenav-container`, `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content`. The `mat-sidenav-container`, as the name suggests, acts as a container for the `sidenav` and the associated content. So it is the parent element, and `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content` are the children sibling elements. `mat-sidenav` represents the sidenav. You can put any content you want, though it is usually used to conatain a list of navigational links. The `mat-sidenav-content` element is for conataining your main page content. Since you need the `sidenav` application-wide, you will put it in the `app.component.html`      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app.component.html in any Editor   To change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.component.html will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">   <button mat-icon-button aria-label=\"menu\" class=\"menu\" (click)=\"sidenav.toggle()\">     <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>   </button>   <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu\">Menu 1</button>   <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>   <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>    <mat-menu #submenu=\"matMenu\">     <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>     <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu2\">Sub-menu 2</button>   </mat-menu>    <mat-menu #submenu2=\"matMenu\">     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 2</button>     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 3</button>   </mat-menu>  </mat-toolbar> <mat-sidenav-container>   <mat-sidenav mode=\"over\" [disableClose]=\"false\" #sidenav>     Sidenav   </mat-sidenav>   <mat-sidenav-content>     <router-outlet></router-outlet>   </mat-sidenav-content> </mat-sidenav-container> ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.    === Changing of the app.component.scss file    ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app.component.scss in any Editor   To change the file app.component.scss, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.scss and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.scss`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.component.scss will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- .menu {     margin-right: auto; } mat-sidenav-container {     position: absolute;     top: 64px;     left: 0;     right: 0;     bottom: 0; } ----   Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.scss.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.scss has been changed.    == Style the sidenav  === Changing of the app.component.html file The sidenav’s width will be corrected when you add the navigational links to it. That is the only thing remaining to be done. Lets implement it now:      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of app.component.html in any Editor   To change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.

If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.  == devonfw setup    If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.  ==== Prerequisites  * You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.       == Add Angular Material  === Installation of package @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations Next you will add Angular Material to your application.      ==== Prerequisites  * Install Node.js. You can download Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/[here]. * Installed npm. You can download npm https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm[here] and follow the installation instructions.  ==== Execution  You can install the package @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations and add it to the dependencies.  Now execute `npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations` in the terminal.   This may take some time.    == Import Material components  === Changing of the app.module.ts file Once the dependencies are installed, you need to import the BrowserAnimationsModule in your AppModule for animations support. Also, Angular Material provides a host of components for designing your application. All the components are well structured into NgModules. For each component from the Angular Material library that you want to use, you have to import the respective NgModule.       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of app.module.ts in the VS Code Editor  To change the file app.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.module.ts`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations'; import { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon'; import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button'; import { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu'; import { MatListModule } from '@angular/material/list'; import { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar'; import { MatSidenavModule } from '@angular/material/sidenav'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';  import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component';  @NgModule({   declarations: [     AppComponent   ],   imports: [     BrowserAnimationsModule,     MatIconModule,     MatButtonModule,     MatMenuModule,     MatListModule,     MatToolbarModule,     MatSidenavModule,     AppRoutingModule   ],   providers: [],   bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }  ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened app.module.ts.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.module.ts has been changed.    == Load Material icons  === Changing of the index.html file To use Material Design Icons along with the mat-icon component, you will load the Material Icons library in your `src/index.html` file.       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of index.html in the VS Code Editor  To change the file index.html, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src` and select the file `index.html`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and index.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, html] ---- <!doctype html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head>   <meta charset=\"utf-8\">   <title>Devon4ngMatLayout</title>   <base href=\"/\">   <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">   <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\" rel=\"stylesheet\">   <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\"> </head> <body>   <app-root></app-root> </body> </html>  ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened index.html.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.html has been changed.    == Add global styles  === Changing of the styles.scss file Now that you have all the Angular Material related dependencies set up in your project, you can start coding. Let’s begin by adding a suitable `margin` and `font` to the body element of your single page application. You will add it in the `src/styles.scss` file to apply it globally.       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of styles.scss in the VS Code Editor  To change the file styles.scss, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to styles.scss and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src` and select the file `styles.scss`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and styles.scss will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, css] ---- @import \"~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\";  body {     margin: 0;     font-family: \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, sans-serif;   } ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened styles.scss.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and styles.scss has been changed.    == Add a header  === Changing of the app.component.html file Clear the `app.component.html` file and setup a header with a menu button and some navigational links. You will use `mat-toolbar`, `mat-button`, `mat-menu`, `mat-icon` and `mat-icon-button` for this:       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor  To change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">   <button mat-icon-button aria-label=\"menu\" class=\"menu\">     <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>   </button>   <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu\">Menu 1</button>   <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>   <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>    <mat-menu #submenu=\"matMenu\">     <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>     <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu2\">Sub-menu 2</button>   </mat-menu>    <mat-menu #submenu2=\"matMenu\">     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 2</button>     <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 3</button>   </mat-menu>  </mat-toolbar> ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.  The color attribute on the mat-toolbar element will give it the primary (indigo) color as defined by your theme. The color attribute works with most Angular Material components; the possible values are `primary`, `accent` and `warn`. The `mat-toolbar` is a suitable component to represent a header. It serves as a placeholder for elements you want in your header. Inside the `mat-toolbar`, you start with a button having `mat-icon-button` attribute, which itself contains a `mat-icon` element having the value `menu`. This will serve as a menu button which you can use to toggle the `sidenav`. You follow it with some sample buttons having the `mat-button` attribute. Notice the first button has a property `matMenuTriggerFor` binded to a local reference submenu. As the property name suggests, the click of this button will display the mat-menu element with the specified local reference as a drop-down menu. The rest of the code is self explanatory.   == Shift header menu buttons to right  === Changing of the app.component.scss file You want to keep the sidenav toggling menu button on the left and move the rest to the right to make it look better. To do this add the following style to the `menu` class in `app.component.scss`:       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of app.component.scss in the VS Code Editor  To change the file app.component.scss, you have to open it in VS Code first.  Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.scss and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.scss`.  You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.scss will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.  Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- .menu {     margin-right: auto; } ----  Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.scss.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.scss has been changed.    == Create navigatable pages  === Create the home.component.html file Next, you will create a sidenav. But before that lets create a couple of components to navigate between, the links of which you will add to the sidenav. You can use the `ng generate component` (or `ng g c` command for short) to create Home and Data components. But here, you will create them manually. You nest them in the `pages` sub-directory since they represent your pages. And you will also add the new components to your AppModule.      ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Creating home.component.html in the VS Code Editor  Create home.component.html in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it.   Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.   Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- <h2>Home Page</h2>  ----  Now insert the copied text into the new file.  The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home/home.component.html*.  Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file.

The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.    == Create the sidenav  === Changing of the app.component.html file Let us finally create the sidenav. To implement the sidenav you need to use 3 Angular Material components: `mat-sidenav-container`, `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content`. The `mat-sidenav-container`, as the name suggests, acts as a container for the `sidenav` and the associated content. So it is the parent element, and `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content` are the children sibling elements. `mat-sidenav` represents the sidenav. You can put any content you want, though it is usually used to conatain a list of navigational links. The `mat-sidenav-content` element is for conataining your main page content. Since you need the `sidenav` application-wide, you will put it in the `app.component.html`       ==== Prerequisites * VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).  ==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor  To change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first.

The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.   The installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.    devonfw-ide is installed successfully with Maven and Java too. These tools can be customized by changing the configuration in devon.properties.

It contains several sample applications for many extensions to Quarkus. For this tutorial, we will use an application with a simple REST service contained in the `rest-json-quickstart` subfolder.      ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. In this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.  After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git` in the terminal.    == Add the ServicedocGen maven plugin  === Changing of the pom.xml file Next step is to add the ServicedocGen plugin to the project's pom.xml       ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor   To change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart` and select the file `pom.xml`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner pom.xml will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text.

text into the opened pom.xml.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.  Take a look at the `configuration` section of the plugin. In this section you can configure the behavior of the plugin. Not all options are necessary, such as the `info` section. This one is only used to add additional information to the OpenAPI file.  Some other parts are necessary. The `classnameRegex` parameter is used to configure which name pattern the REST service classes must match.  The `templates` section is used to configure what is created by the plugin. In this case, the OpenAPI specification is created in yaml format and the Swagger UI file is also created.   "

On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.   The installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.      == Clone quarkus-quickstarts repository  === Clone Repository First, clone the `quarkus-quickstarts` repository from GitHub. It contains several sample applications for many extensions to Quarkus. For this tutorial, we will use an application with a simple REST service contained in the `rest-json-quickstart` subfolder.      ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. In this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.  After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git` in the terminal.    == Add the ServicedocGen maven plugin  === Changing of the pom.xml file Next step is to add the ServicedocGen plugin to the project's pom.xml       ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor   To change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart` and select the file `pom.xml`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner pom.xml will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text.

text into the opened pom.xml.  The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.  Take a look at the `configuration` section of the plugin. In this section you can configure the behavior of the plugin. Not all options are necessary, such as the `info` section. This one is only used to add additional information to the OpenAPI file.  Some other parts are necessary. The `classnameRegex` parameter is used to configure which name pattern the REST service classes must match.  The `templates` section is used to configure what is created by the plugin. In this case, the OpenAPI specification is created in yaml format and the Swagger UI file is also created.   "

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows].

If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.

You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.   The installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.      == Clone quarkus-quickstarts repository  === Clone Repository First, clone the `quarkus-quickstarts` repository from GitHub. It contains several sample applications for many extensions to Quarkus. We will use a simple REST service for this tutorial and customize the application accordingly.      ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.

After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git` in the terminal.    == Add the extension  === Changing of the pom.xml file The next step is to add the Smallrye OpenAPI extension to the project. Open the `pom.xml` file of project in the folder `rest-json-quickstart`. Add the extension `quarkus-smallrye-openapi` to the list of dependencies.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor   To change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor.

The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.    == Create the application.properties file By default, the Swagger UI is enabled only in development mode. To enable it in all cases, set the property `quarkus.swagger-ui.always-include=true` in the application.properties file of the Quarkus project.     ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * Any Editor that can edit files  ==== Creating application.properties in any Editor  Create application.properties in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .  Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work. The editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.   Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- quarkus.swagger-ui.always-include=true ----  Now insert the copied text into the new file.  The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart/src/main/resources/application.properties*.  Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart/src/main/resources`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `application.properties` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and application.properties has been created and filled with some data.   "

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default. * You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)  Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.  ==== Download    Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].  In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.  On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.  On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.    After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.  ==== Setup  First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.  For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it. For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide. Start the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).  You can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.   The installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.      == Clone quarkus-quickstarts repository  === Clone Repository First, clone the `quarkus-quickstarts` repository from GitHub. It contains several sample applications for many extensions to Quarkus. We will use a simple REST service for this tutorial and customize the application accordingly.      ==== Prerequisites * You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.  ==== Download Open a terminal in your current workspace.  Firstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to. If the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. In this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.  After that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.  To clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git` in the terminal.    == Add the extension  === Changing of the pom.xml file The next step is to add the Smallrye OpenAPI extension to the project. Open the `pom.xml` file of project in the folder `rest-json-quickstart`. Add the extension `quarkus-smallrye-openapi` to the list of dependencies.      ==== Prerequisites * Any editor that can edit files  ==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor   To change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor.  Open the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works.  Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart` and select the file `pom.xml`.  You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner pom.xml will be opened in a new editor window.  Copy the following text.

The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.    == Create the application.properties file By default, the Swagger UI is enabled only in development mode. To enable it in all cases, set the property `quarkus.swagger-ui.always-include=true` in the application.properties file of the Quarkus project.     ==== Prerequisites * Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor). * Any Editor that can edit files  ==== Creating application.properties in any Editor  Create application.properties in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .  Opening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work. The editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.   Copy the following text. [source, ] ---- quarkus.swagger-ui.always-include=true ----  Now insert the copied text into the new file.  The next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s. A file explorer window opens. You should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart/src/main/resources/application.properties*.  Select the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart/src/main/resources`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again. To save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `application.properties` in the text field *File name:*.  The last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and application.properties has been created and filled with some data.   "
