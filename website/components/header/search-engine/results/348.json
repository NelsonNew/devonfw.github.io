The architecture does not enforce it generally. What you should keep in mind is, that there is always a point when it becomes recommendable.\n\n\nFor example a template with 800 line of code is:\n\n\n\n\nnot understandable\n\n\nnot maintainable\n\n\nnot testable\n\n\nnot reusable\n\n\n\n\nSo when implementing a template with more than 50 line of code you should think about decomposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
