During our discussion on how many user stories we could work on in Sprint 2 we needed to remind ourselves that the overall target is to develop an example application for the devonfw. Considering this we aligned on a clear target for Sprint 2: To focus on finishing User Stories as we need to aim for a practicable and realizable solution. Everybody aligned on the aim of having a working application at the end of Sprint 2.\nFor the estimation process of user stories we make again usage of planningpoker.com as the team prefers this “easy-to-use” tool. During our second estimation process we had the situation in which the estimated story points differs strongly from one team member to another. In this case the team members shortly explains how the understood and interpreted the user story. It turned out that team members misinterpreted the user stories. With having this discussion all team members got the same understanding of the specific functionality and scope of a user story. After the alignment the team members adjusted their estimations.\nBeside this need for discussion the team estimated most of the user stories with very similar story points. This fact shows the increase within the effort estimation for each team member in comparison to Sprint 1 planning. Over the short time of two Sprint planning the team received a better understanding and feeling for the estimation with story points.\n\n\n\n"}
