Adapters handle back-end communication\n\n\nAs illustrated in the figure a Use Case service does not use Angular HttpClient directly but uses an adapter.\nA basic adapter could look like this:\n\n\nListing 64. Example adapter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adapters should use a well-defined transfer data model.\nThis could be generated from server endpoints with CobiGen, Swagger, typescript-maven-plugin, etc.\nIf inside the application there is a business model defined, the adapter has to parse to the transfer model.\nThis is illustrated in the following listing.\n\n\nListing 65.
