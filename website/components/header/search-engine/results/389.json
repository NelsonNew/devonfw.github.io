If you are using Nx, the command would be nx generate @nrwl/angular:app devon4ng-mat-layout --routing --style=scss in your Nx workspace. Click here to get started with using Nx.\n\n\n\n\nWe are providing the routing flag so that a routing module is generated, and we are also setting the style sheet format to SCSS with --style=scss.\n\n\nOnce the creation process is complete, open your newly created application in Visual Studio Code. Try running the empty application by running the following command in the integrated terminal:\n\n\n\n\nng serve. (If you are using Nx, you have to specify the project name along with the --project flag, so the command becomes ng serve --project=devon4ng-mat-layout)\n\n\n\n\nAngular will spin up a server and you can check your application by visiting http://localhost:4200/ in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 59.
