For the discussion we extended this particular Review meeting to 90min. As this discussion took almost 2/3 of the Review meeting we only had a short time left for our review of Sprint 1. For the following scrum events we decided to focus on the primary target of these events and have discussions needed for alignments in separate meetings.\nRegarding the topic of splitting user stories we had the example of a certain user story which included a functionality of a twitter integration (ICSDSHOW-17 User Profile and Twitter integration). As the twitter functionality could not have been implemented at this early point of time we thought about cutting the user story into two user stories. We aligned on mocking the twitter functionality until the dependencies are developed in order to test the components. As this user story is estimated with 13 story points it is a good example for the question whether to cut a user story into multiple user stories or not.\nUnfortunately not all user stories of Sprint 1 could have been completed. Due this situation we discussed on whether pushing all unfinished user stories into the status done or moving them to Sprint 2. We aligned on transferring the unfinished user stories into the next Sprint. During the Sprint 1 the team underestimated that a lot of holidays crossed the Sprint 1 goals. As taking holidays and absences of team members into consideration is part of a Sprint Planning we have a learning effect on setting a Sprint Scope.\n\n\n\n"}
