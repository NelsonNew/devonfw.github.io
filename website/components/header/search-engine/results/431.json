We advise you to keep Yarn 1.x (Classic) as your global binary by installing it via the instructions you can find here.\n\n\nOnce youâ€™ve followed the instructions (running yarn --version from your home directory should yield something like 1.22.0), go to the next section to see how to enable Yarn 2 on your project.\n\n\n\n"}
