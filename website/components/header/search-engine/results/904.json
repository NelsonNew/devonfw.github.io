Usage of devon docker\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument(s)\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nsetup\nsetup Docker (install and verify) as per above flow.\n\n\n«args»\ncall docker with the specified arguments. Call docker help for details or use docker directly as preferred.\" («args»)\n\n\n\n\nsetup\n\nThe Docker commandlet will install Docker automatically.\nPlease note that besides the sandbox concept of devonfw-ide this is a global installation on your system.\nWhen uninstalling devonfw-ide, you may have to manually uninstall Docker and Kubernetes if you do not need it anymore.\n\n\nrequirements\n\nRunning Docker and especially Kubernetes on your machine in the background will require quite some resources.\nThis will allocate at least 2GB of additional RAM.\n\n\nYou will need at least 8GB of total RAM while we recommend to use 16GB+.\n\n\nYou may also tune and scale it to your needs.\nWhen using Docker Desktop (Windows or MacOS) simply go to the resources tab in the settings.\nIt will depend on your usage frequency if you want to have it running in the background all the time.\nThis is a balance between resource utilization and convenience.\nIf you use Docker and Kubernetes on your local machine on a daily basis this makes sense.\n\n\nIn case you only use Docker rarely, you can save resources by stopping it when not needed after it has been installed.\n\n\n\nWindows and macOS\n\nTo enable or disable autostart, you can launch Docker Desktop on Windows or MacOS got to the Preferences (gear icon in the title bar). Then in the General tab you can check or uncheck the option Start Docker Desktop when you login (see also here). When autostart is disabled and you launch Docker Desktop it will notice and ask your to start the service or do this automatically for you.\nOn Windows you can also manually tweak this:\n\n\n\n\nHit [windows][r]\n\n\nEnter services.msc\n\n\nConfirm with OK\n\n\nIn the services app search for the Docker Desktop Service in the list and select it.\n\n\nNow you can start or stop the service by clicking on the according link text.\n\n\nAlso when right clicking on Docker Desktop Service and selecting Options from the context-menu, you can change the start type to automatic or manual.\n\n\n\n\nMac A1\n\nIn case you have a new Mac with A1 CPU, we automatically download and install the according ARM version of Docker Desktop for macOS.\nHowever, if you use Docker and search for images you may end up with errors like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo with A1 CPU you may need to add --platform linux/x86_64 as option to your Docker command to find the expected container image.\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\nThere is no Docker Desktop for Linux.\nAs Docker initially comes from the Linux world, it is easy to set it up on a Linux machine and use it from the commandline.\nTherefore we do not install a GUI for you in case you are a Linux user.\nIn case you need a GUI for Docker and Kubernetes on Linux you can choose from the following options:\n\n\n\n\nDockStation\n\n\nPortainer\n\n\nKitematic\n\n\nShipyard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusage\n\nOnce installed via setup, you can run Docker directly from any shell of your OS directly.\nRun docker help to get started and use the online documentations and resources on the web to get familiar with Docker.\nIt is not our intention to repeat this here.\n\n\nPlease note that the docker commandlet is a command wrapper.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
