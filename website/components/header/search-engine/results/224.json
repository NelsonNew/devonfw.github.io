It will not only upgrade dependencies and their related ones but also will perform some fixes in your code if available thanks to the provided schematics. It will check even if the update is not possible as there is another library or libraries that are not compatible with the versions of the upgraded dependencies. In this case it will keep your application untouched.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe repository must be in a clean state before executing a ng update. So, remember to commit your changes first.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
