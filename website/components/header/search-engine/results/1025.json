The SCM used is \"Git\" and the repository URL is the MyThaiStar repository https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star.git or your fork of it.\n\n\nThe Branch Specifier should point to */develop, the Script Path is jenkins/nKaaS/Jenkinsfile as that’s where the Jenkinsfile is located at the MyThaiStar repository.\nChecking the \"Lightweight checkout\" could speed up the Pipeline.\n\n\nNote: If you’re using the nKaaS Bitbucket as repository for your MyThaiStar clone you have to perform some additional configurations. First you’ll have to create a new SSH keypair, for example with ssh-keygen. Add the public key to the Bitbucket authentication methods and the private key in Jenkins to a new pair of credentials. This step is required for Jenkins to be able to authenticate against Bitbucket.\nAfterwards, instead of the official MyThaiStar repository, specify your Bitbucket repository:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder \"Credentials\" choose the credentials that contain your Bitbucket private key you’ve created earlier.\n\n\n\n"}
