However, as new features are added, the overall application size grows up  and its loading speed decreases. It is in this context where Lazy loading finds its place.\nLazy loading is a design pattern that defers initialization of objects until it is needed, so, for example, users that just access to a websiteâ€™s home page do not need to have other areas loaded.\nAngular handles lazy loading through the routing module which redirects to requested pages. Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand.\n\n\n"}
