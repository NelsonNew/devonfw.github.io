Although services can be used for this layer, they should not be confused with the service layer. Services in this layer are responsible for data access, while services in the service layer are responsible for business logic. TypeORM supports the most commonly used relational databases, link Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MSSQL and others. Also, it supports no-relational databases like MongoDB.\n\n\nTypeORM supports Active Record and Repository patterns. We recommend to use the Repository pattern. This pattern allows you to separate the data objects from the methods to manipulate the database.\n\n\n\n"}
