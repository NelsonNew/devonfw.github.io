The estimation process usually is part of the backlog refinement meeting. Regarding the project circumstances we decided to estimate the user stories during the Sprint Planning. Starting the estimation process we noticed that we had to align our interpretation of the estimation effort as these story points are not equivalent to a certain time interval. The story points are relative values to compare the effort of the user stories. With this in mind we proceeded with the estimation of the user stories. We decided to start Sprint 1 with the following user stories and the total amount of 37 story points:\n•\tICSDSHOW-2\tCreate invite for friends\t(8  Story Points)\n•\tICSDSHOW-4\tCreate reservation\t\t(3)\n•\tICSDSHOW-5\tHandle invite\t\t\t(3)\n•\tICSDSHOW-6\tRevoke accepted invite \t(5)\n•\tICSDSHOW-9\tCancel invite\t\t\t(3)\n•\tICSDSHOW-11\tFilter menu\t\t\t(5)\n•\tICSDSHOW-12\tDefine order\t\t\t(5)\n•\tICSDSHOW-13\tOrder the order\t\t(5)\nAs the Sprint Planning is time boxed to one hour we managed to hold this meeting within this time window.\n\n\n\n"}
