Its a built in package that you can install in your project: @devon4node/config.\n\n\nThe main difference with other configuration modules is that @devon4node/config stores all configuration in typescript files. With that you will be able to configure different values depending on the environment, but also you can configure functions, arrays, objects and so on. As some configurations must secret and that configuration will be known only at runtime, it also provides a mechanism to override your configuration by using environment variables.\n\n\nWith @devon4node/config you will be able to validate your configuration based on class-validator.\n\n\n"}
