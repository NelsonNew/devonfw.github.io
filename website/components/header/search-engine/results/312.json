This is mainly about accessing data from a persistent data-store but also about invoking external services.\n\n\nThis layer is implemented using providers. Those providers could be: services, repositories and others. Although services can be used for this layer, they should not be confused with the service layer. Services in this layer are responsible for data access, while services in the service layer are responsible for business logic.\n\n\n"}
