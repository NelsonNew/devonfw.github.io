Following this principle we will be able to do easy to maintain applications.\n\n\nFor example, in order to expose all CRUD operations for an entity, you only need to create a controller like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find this code in the employee example. Only with this code your exposing the full CRUD operations for the employee entity. As you can see, it’s an empty class with some decorators and the EmployeeCrudService injected as dependency. Simple, isn’t it? The EmployeeCrudService is also simple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother empty class which extends from TypeOrmCrudService&lt;Employee&gt; and injects the Employee Repository as dependency. Nothing else.\n\n\nWith these examples you can get an idea of how simple it can be to code a devon4node application .\n\n\n\n"}
