This is also valid for the next steps.\n\n\n\n\nThen, upgrade Angular:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case you use Angular Material:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the application depends on third party libraries, the new tool ngcc can be run to make them compatible with the new Ivy compiler. In this case it is recommended to include a postinstall script in the package.json:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information at https://angular.io/guide/updating-to-version-9 and https://angular.io/guide/ivy.\n\n\nImportant use cases:\n\n\n\n\nTo update to the next beta or pre-release version, use the --next=true option.\n\n\nTo update from one major version to another, use the format ng update @angular/cli@^&lt;major_version&gt; @angular/core@^&lt;major_version&gt;.\n\n\nIn case your Angular application uses @angular/material include it in the first command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIonic/Angular applications\n\nJust following the same procedure we can upgrade Angular applications, but we must take care of important specific Ionic dependencies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther dependencies\n\nEvery application will make use of different dependencies. Angular CLI ng upgrade will also take care of these ones. For example, if you need to upgrade @capacitor you will perform:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother example could be that you need to upgrade @ngx-translate packages. As always in this case you will execute:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngular Update Guide online tool\n\nIt is recommended to use the Angular Update Guide tool at https://update.angular.io/ that will provide the necessary steps to upgrade any Angular application depending on multiple criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
