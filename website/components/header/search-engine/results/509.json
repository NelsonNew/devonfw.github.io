If you want to change the configuration file, you only need to set the NODE_ENV environment property with the name of the desired environment. Examples: in windows execute set NODE_ENV=develop before executing the application, in Linux execute NODE_ENV=develop before executing the application or NODE_ENV=develop yarn start.\n\n\nIn most scenarios, when you want to use a environment file you want to use the same values as the default.ts file and override some properties. For that, what @devon4node/config do is a merge of the default configuration file with the selected configuration file, so you donâ€™t need to repeat all configuration values in all configuration files, you need to put only the values that are different to the default one.\n\n\n\n"}
