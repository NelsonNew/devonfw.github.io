The prerequisites for this process are a CI environment, preferably a Production Line instance, and the ESLint CLI, which is already included when generating a new devon4node project.\n\n\nConfiguring the ESLint analysis\n\nYou can configure the ESLint analysis parameters in the .eslintrc.js file inside the top-level directory of your project. If you created your node project using the devon4node application schematic, this file will already exist. If you want to make further adjustments to it, have a look at the ESLint documentation.\n\n\nThe ESLint analysis script lint is already configured in the scripts part of your package.json. Simply add -f json &gt; report.json, so that the output of the analysis is saved in a .json file. Additional information to customization options for the ESLint CLI can be found here.\n\n\nTo run the analysis, execute the script with npm run lint inside the base directory of your project.\n\n\n\nConfiguring SonarQube\n\nIf you havenâ€™t already generated your CICD-related files, follow the tutorial on the devon4node schematic of our CICDGEN project, as you will need a Jenkinsfile configured in your project to proceed.\n\n\nInside the script for the SonarQube code analysis in your Jenkinsfile, add the parameter -Dsonar.eslint.reportPaths=report.json. Now, whenever a SonarQube analysis is triggered by your CI environment, the generated report will be loaded into your SonarQube instance.\nTo avoid duplicated issues, you can associate an empty TypeScript quality profile with your project in its server configurations.\n\n\n\n\n"}
