As a pre-requisite, you should already have an application in your Nx workspace which you want to run as a front-end in your Electron app. (You can follow this guide if you want to get started with Nx).\n\n\nFollow the steps below to develop an Electron app in your Nx workspace:\n\n\nInstall nx-electron\n\nInstall nx-electron using the command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will add the packages electron and nx-electron as dev dependencies to your Nx workspace. This will help us generate our Electron app in the next step.\n\n\n\nGenerate your Electron app\n\nOnce you have installed nx-electron, you can generate your electron app using the command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that is it! You have generated your Electron app already. All the configuration files (tsconfig.*) are generated for you under &lt;electron-app-name&gt; in your Nx workspace.\n\n\n\nServing your app\n\nYou can use this command to serve your Electron app:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see a blank application, it is because the Electron app was served before the front-end was served. To avoid this, you can serve the front-end and back-end separately, (that is, serve the back-end only after the front-end is served).\n\n\n\nBuilding your app\n\nThe command for building your Electron app in Nx is similar to the serve command above, you only change the target from serve to build:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackaging your app\n\nMake sure you have build your app before you try to package it using the following command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe options that can be passed can be found here.\n\n\nYou can find a working example of an Electron app in devon4ts-samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
