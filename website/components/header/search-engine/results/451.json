For that reason, in devonfw we decided to make use of Angular since it is a full front-end framework that includes almost all the different patterns and features that any SPA may need and provides a well defined architecture to development, build and deploy.\n\n\nThe idea with devon4ng is to define an architecture which is a compromise between, on the one hand, leveraging the best practices and latest trends like reactive style development, on the other hand, providing a short on-boarding time while still using an architecture that helps us scale and be productive at the same time.\n\n\nAt the same time devon4ng aims to help developers to solve common problems that appear in many projects and provide samples and blueprints to show how to apply this solutions in real situations.\n\n\n\n"}
