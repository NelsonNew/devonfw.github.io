Husky is a tool that allows you to configure git hooks easily in your project. When you make a git commit in your devon4node project, it will execute two actions:\n\n\n\n\nPrettify the staged files\n\n\nExecute the linter in the staged files\n\n\n\n\nIf any action fails, you wonâ€™t be able to commit your new changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to skip the git hooks, you can do a commit passing the --no-verify flag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
