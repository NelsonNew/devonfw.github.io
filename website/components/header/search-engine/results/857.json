For this reason, we aim to rationalize, harmonize and standardize the development assets for software projects and industrialize the software development process.\n\n\n\nIndustrialization of Innovative Technologies &amp; “Digital”\n\ndevonfw’s goal is to standardize &amp; industrialize. But this applies not only to large volume, “traditional” custom software development projects. devonfw also aims to offer a standardized platform which contains a range of state-of-the-art methodologies and technology stacks. devonfw supports agile development by small teams utilizing the latest technologies for projects related to Mobile, IoT and the Cloud.\n\n\n\nDeliver &amp; Improve Business Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency\n\n\n\nUp to 20% reduction in time to market, with faster delivery due to automation and reuse.\n\n\nUp to 25% less implementation efforts due to code generation and reuse.\n\n\nFlat pyramid and rightshore, ready for junior developers.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality\n\n\n\nState-of-the-art architecture and design.\n\n\nLower cost on maintenance and warranty.\n\n\nTechnical debt reduction by reuse.\n\n\nRisk reduction due to continuous improvement of individual assets.\n\n\nStandardized, automated quality checks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgility\n\n\n\nFocus on business functionality, not on technicalities.\n\n\nShorter release cycles.\n\n\nDevOPS by design — Infrastructure as Code.\n\n\nContinuous Delivery pipeline.\n\n\nOn- and off-premise flexibility.\n\n\nPoCs and prototypes in days not months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
