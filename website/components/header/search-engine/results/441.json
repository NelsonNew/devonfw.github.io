Routing module declaration\n\n\nIt is important to define routes inside app routing module with .forRoot() and in feature routing modules with .forChild().\n\n\nExample 1 - No Lazy Loading\n\nIn this example two modules need to be configured with routes - AppModule and FlightModule.\n\n\nThe following routes will be configured\n\n\n\n\n/ will redirect to /search\n\n\n/search displays FlightSearchComponent (FlightModule)\n\n\n/search/print/:flightId/:date displays FlightPrintComponent (FlightModule)\n\n\n/search/details/:flightId/:date displays FlightDetailsComponent (FlightModule)\n\n\nAll other routes will display ErrorPage404 (AppModule)\n\n\n\n\nListing 71. app-routing.module.ts\n\n\n\n\n\nListing 72. flight-search-routing.module.ts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nThe import order inside AppModule is important.\nAppRoutingModule needs to be imported after FlightModule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2 - Lazy Loading\n\nLazy Loading is a good practice when the application has multiple feature areas and a user might not visit every dialog.\nOr at least he might not need every dialog up front.\n\n\nThe following example will configure the same routes as example 1 but will lazy load FlightModule.\n\n\nListing 73. app-routing.module.ts\n\n\n\n\n\nListing 74. flight-search-routing.module.ts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
