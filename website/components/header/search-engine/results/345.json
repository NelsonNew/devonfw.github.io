How do we propagate the data to the components and how can we send user interaction from the components to the our data \"manager\" logic.\n\n\nThe answer to all these questions is an Angular Service (that we will just call a service from now on).\n\n\nA service is an injectable logic that can be consumed by all the components that need it. It can carry manipulation functions and ,in our case, fetch data from a provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 69. Angular Components &amp; Services architecture.\n\n\nInside the Angular App, an Injector gives access to each component to their required services. Itâ€™s good coding practice to use a distinct service to each data type you want to manipulate. The type is described in a interface.\n\n\nStill, our ideas drive in different ways, so we have to stay flexible. We cannot use a database at the moment, but we want a way to represent data on screen, which can grow organically.\n\n\nLearn more about Angular Services\n\n\n\n"}
