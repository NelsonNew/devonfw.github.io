Data box in relation to services and components.\n\n\nLetâ€™s consider a 'box of data' represented in JSON. Physically, this means a folder with some JSON/TS files in it. They are located in the app/mock folder. The example uses only one mock data file. The file is typed according to our data model.\n\n\nPro tip: separate your files based on purpose. In your source code, put the mock files in the mock folder, components in the components folder, services in the services folder and data models in the models folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 71. Project structure.\n\n\nAligned with the Angular way of development, we are implementing a model-view-controller pattern.\n\n\nThe model is represented by the interfaces we make. These interfaces describe the data structures we will use in our application. In this example, there is one data model, corresponding with the 'type' of data that was mocked. In the models folder you will find the .ts script file that describes chemical elements. The corresponding mock file defines a set is chemical elements objects, in accordance to our interface definition.\n\n\n\n"}
