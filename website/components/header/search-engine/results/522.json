Sometimes this is not enough. In some situations you need to exclude some property (e.g password). Instead doing it manually, devon4node provides an interceptor (ClassSerializerInterceptor) that will do it for you. You only need to return a class instance as always and the interceptor will transform those class to the expected data.\n\n\nThe ClassSerializerInterceptor takes the class-transformer decorators in order to know how to transform the class and then send the result to the client.\n\n\nSome of class-transformer decorators are:\n\n\n\n\nExpose\n\n\nExclude\n\n\nType\n\n\nTransform\n\n\n\n\nAnd methods to transform data:\n\n\n\n\nplainToClass\n\n\nplainToClassFromExist\n\n\nclassToPlain\n\n\nclassToClass\n\n\nserialize\n\n\ndeserialize\n\n\ndeserializeArray\n\n\n\n\nSee the class-transformer page for more information.\n\n\nSee NestJS serialization page for more information about ClassSerializerInterceptor.\n\n\n\n\n"}
