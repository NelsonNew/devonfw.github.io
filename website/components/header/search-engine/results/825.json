At the end of this phase the internal data model should clearly represent all components and their assigned licenses in normalized form.\n\n\nThe phase itself consists of two decision tables / rule groups:\n\n\nDecision Table: Explicitely setting Licenses\n\nWith this decision table is is possible to explicitely assign NormalizedLicenses to components. This will be used if the imported RawLicense data is either incomplete or incorrect. Items which have been processed by rules of this group will not be reprocessed by the next rule group.\n\n\n\n\nLHS conditions:\n\n\n\nEngagement.clientName\n\n\nEngagement.engagementName\n\n\nApplication.applicationName\n\n\nApplicationComponent.groupId \n\n\nApplicationCompomnent.artifactId \n\n\nApplicationComponent.version \n\n\nRawLicense.declaredLicense \n\n\nRawLicense.url \n\n\n\n\n\nRHS result:\n\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseType\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseUrl\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: On these fields the Extended comparison syntax might be used\n\n\nAll RawLicenses which are in scope of fired rules will be marked so that they do not get reprocessed by the following decision table.\n\n\n\nDecision Table: Detecting Licenses from Imported Data\n\nWith this decision table the license info from the RawLicense is mapped to the NormalizedLicense.
