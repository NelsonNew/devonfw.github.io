Once enabled, in addition to supplying your username and password to login, youâ€™ll be prompted for a code generated by your Google Authenticator. For example, a password manager on one of your devices.\n\n\nBy enabling 2FA, to log into your account an additional one-time password is required what requires access to your paired device. This massively increases the barrier for an attacker to break into your account.\n\n\nBack-end mechanism\n\nIn the back-end, we utilize Spring Security for any authentication.\n\n\nFollowing the arrows, one can see all processes regarding authentication. The main idea is to check all credentials depending on their 2FA status and then either grand access to the specific user or deny access. This picture illustrates a normal authentication with username and password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen dealing with 2FA, another provider and filter is handling the request from /verify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you can observe which filter will be used.\nJWT-Authentication-Filter does intercept any request, which enforces being authenticated via JWT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever the secret or qr code gets transferred between two parties, one must enforce SSL/TLS or IPsec to be comply with RFC 6238.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Two-Factor Authentication\n\nIn the current state, TOTP\nwill be used for OTP generation. For this purpose we recommend the Google Authenticator or any TOTP generator out there.\n\n\n\n\nLogin with your account\n\n\nOpen the 2FA settings\n\n\nActivate the 2FA Status\n\n\nInitialize your device with either a QR-Code or a secret\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend\n\nThese are the two main options, which you can obtain my toggling between QR-Code and secret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter an activation and logout. This prompt will ask you to enter the OTP given from your device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
