Make sure to change the given password to a personal one within the 24 hour time period, otherwise the  credentials will expire.\n\n\nAfter successfully following the guide mentioned in the welcome mail you should be able to establish a connection to the nKaaS VPN and have access to all their services (Jenkins, BitBucket, etc.). You should also be able to communicate with Kubernetes using kubectl.\n\n\nKnown issues: The nKaaS guide provides a download link for OpenVPN Connect. However, some users experienced connection issues with this client. If you’re having issues connecting to the VPN with OpenVPN Connect, you may try out the client by OVPN.\n\n\n\nRequesting a namespace\n\nInitially, you won’t be able to edit anything on Kubernetes, as you don’t have any privileges on any namespace. To request your own namespace you should raise a ticket at the Customer Support Portal containing your desired name for the namespace.\n\n\nAs soon as the namespace was created you can change your kubectl context:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn your own namespace you should have permissions to create/delete deployments/services etc. and perform other actions.\n\n\n\n\n"}
