These scripts then interact with other tools, frameworks, and third-party IDEs to streamline the development workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of this approach is, that you can have as many instances of the devonfw-ide on your machine as you need — for different projects with different tools, tool versions and configurations. No need for a physical installation and no tweaking of your operating system required!\n\n\nInstances of the devonfw-ide do not interfere with each other, nor with other installed software. The package size of the devonfw-ide is initally very small, the setup is simple, and the included software is portable.\n\n\nIDEs\n\nIt supports the following IDEs:\n\n\n\n\nEclipse\n\n\nVisual Studio Code\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatforms\n\nIt supports the following platforms:\n\n\n\n\nJava (see also devon4j)\n\n\nNode.js (see also devon4node)\n\n\nAngular (see also devon4ng)\n\n\nC# (see also devon4net)\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild-Systems\n\nIt supports the following build-systems:\n\n\n\n\nMaven\n\n\nNPM\n\n\nGradle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nOther IDEs, platforms, or tools can easily be integrated as commandlets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCobiGen\n\nCobiGen is a code generator included in the devonfw-ide, that allows users to generate the project structure and large parts of the application component code. This saves a lot of time, which is usually wasted on repetitive engineering tasks and/or writing boilerplate code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the same philosophy as the devonfw-ide, CobiGen bundles a new command line interface (CLI), that enables the generation of code using only a few commands. This approach also allows us to decouple CobiGen from Eclipse and use it alongside VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
