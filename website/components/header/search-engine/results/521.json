This example is the implementation of My Thai Star backend, which is compatible with the frontend made with Angular. To do that, this node implementation exposes the same API as Java backend. Take care with this example, as we need to follow the Java API, some components do not follow the devon4node patterns and code conventions.\n\n\n"}
