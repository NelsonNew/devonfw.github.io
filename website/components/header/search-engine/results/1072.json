For usage, the templates have to be specified in the “writers” section of the solicitor configuration file (see Writers and Reporting).\nIn the default solicitor configuration all templates are specified. (see [Appendix A: Default Base Configuration])\n\n\nSolicitor_Output_Template_Sample.xlsx\n\nWith this template a report in Excel format can be created. The spreadsheet contains data from the internal database (see [Database Structure]) which can be fetched by specifying the path to the SQL statements files in the solicitor configuration file.\n\n\n\nSolicitor_Diff_Template_Sample.vm\n\nThis template creates a HTML document which has a table containing the relevant data from the internal database. Cells that have been changed, compared to a previous solicitor run, are marked in a different color. For usage, the option -d &lt;filename&gt; needs to be appended with filename being saved_latest_model.json.\n\n\n\nSolicitor_Output_Template_Sample.vm\n\nThis template creates an HTML document which has an overview of OSS components used in the project. The data is displayed in a table with the columns:\nName, GroupId, Version, Application, License, LicenseUrl.\n\n\n\nSolicitor_Output_Template_Sample_v2.vm\n\nSimilar to the above but uses guessed license URLs and content, see Guessing of license URLs.\n\n\n\nQuality_Report.vm\n\nThis template creates an HTML document which contains OSS components that have been mapped to multiple licenses. The data is displayed in a table with the columns:\nApplication, OSS Name/Product, OSS ArtifactId, OSS Version, Effective Normalized Licenses, License Count.\n\n\n\nScancodeDownloadScript.vm\n\nThis template creates a script file for using ScanCode to create a JSON document which contains copyright information (statements, holders, authors) about each artifact within a project. Copyright information\nis displayed on file level. The output format being a JSON allows for further usage and processing as we store it in a valid syntax with an array of artifacts that contain all infos.\nThe copyright scanner used for this report is scancode-toolkit-21.8.4. Usage information can be found in the created scancode_project.sh script after running solicitor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis report is an experimental feature and might be changed or removed in future versions without any notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
