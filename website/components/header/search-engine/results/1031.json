It has been developed for supporting project engagements with individual tools like issue tracking, continuous integration, continuous deployment, documentation, binary storage and much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough the PL Project is a wide set of tools, only 3 are going to be mainly used for My Thai Star projects to build a Continuous Integration and Continuos Delivery environment. All three are available in the PL instance used for this project.\n\n\n\n\nJenkins\n\nThis is going to be the \"main tool\". Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the development with Continuos Integration and is going to host all Pipelines (and, obviously, execute them).\n\n\n\nNexus\n\nNexus manages software \"artifacts\" required for development. It is possible to both download dependencies from Nexus and publish artifacts as well. It allows to share resources within an organization.\n\n\n\nSonarQube\n\nIt is a platform for continuous inspection of the code. It is going to be used for the Java back-end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
